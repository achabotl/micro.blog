It's a little less drum n' bass, a little more like older Amon Tobin and/or Two Fingers.\n- [Current Value – Heavy Weight](https://open.spotify.com/track/2EWShr4d4XoqZ1F9YCZlTF): On the same EP as Underhill's Dead Foot.\n- [Rachael Dadd – Feather](https://open.spotify.com/track/1D4GCiUM65WqeMqCbiTL9W)\n- [Noname – beauty supply](https://open.spotify.com/track/5TAqSeSM6JI5AGAmMHoSAu): Jazzy hip-hop. I dig it. I like this album even more than her 2016 Telefone.\n- [Son Lux – Easy](https://open.spotify.com/track/5Ie8El2q8jpSfgQrEgjQ0g): This is *so* different from the [original song](https://open.spotify.com/track/0BQMym4vrghWvHFDQybmRa?si=78c9a7e81ad04bbe)! *Fascinating*!\n- [Son Lux – No Crimes (New History)](https://open.spotify.com/track/3LinyAf9FNWEjIhwbjgjkf): This remix feels even more Son Lux-y than the original song.\n- [Tomu DJ – Band Man](https://open.spotify.com/track/3jHI9Y1DTvjQxzlISLt81o)\n",

This sentence was key: &ldquo;After all, you presumably don&rsquo;t feel overwhelmed by all the unread books in the British Library – and not because there aren&rsquo;t an overwhelming number of them, but because it never occurred to you that it might be your job to get through them all.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>Watch <a href=\"https://kottke.org/22/01/one-minute-time-machine\">One-Minute Time Machine</a>, a delightful and surprising short film.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-big-idea-cynefin\">The Big Idea: Cynefin</h2>\n\n<p>The Cynefin framework (kuh-NEV-in) is a framework to make decisions by making sense of the domain you&rsquo;re in: <em>clear</em>, <em>complicated</em>, <em>complex</em>, and <em>chaotic</em>. Depending on the domain, the &ldquo;right thing to do&rdquo; will change.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The <em>clear</em> domain is <em>known knowns</em>. Things are stable, causes and effects are clear. It&rsquo;s the world of rules and <em>best practices</em>: you acquire data (sense), categorize them, and respond appropriately.</li>\n<li>In the <em>complicated</em> domain, it&rsquo;s <em>known unknowns</em>. You don&rsquo;t know the cause-and-effect relationship, but you can figure it out with analysis. You sense, <em>analyze</em>, then respond. It&rsquo;s the domain of experts: engineers, lawyers, and surgeons.</li>\n<li>In the <em>complex</em> domain, it&rsquo;s <em>unknown unknowns</em>. You figure out the cause and effects after the fact. You must <em>probe</em> the system first, sense, then respond. Probes are experiments that are safe to fail. Here are markets, culture, and much of software development.</li>\n<li>In the <em>chaotic</em> domain, cause and effect are… a mess. You  can&rsquo;t take wait to figure out what they are. You must <em>act</em> first, then sense and respond. Be quick and decisive. This is crisis management, September 11, and March 2020 and the COVID pandemic. You want to get out of this domain ASAP.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Things go wrong when the approach you chose doesn&rsquo;t match the domain you&rsquo;re in. It would be a valuable framework to convey to clients that want you to take the wrong approach, but teaching it to them is a tall order. Here&rsquo;s a great quote from the HBR paper <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2007/11/a-leaders-framework-for-decision-making\">A Leader’s Framework for Decision Making</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>As in the other contexts, leaders face several challenges in the complex domain. Of primary concern is the temptation to fall back into traditional command-and-control management styles—to demand fail-safe business plans with defined outcomes. Leaders who don’t recognize that a complex domain requires a more experimental mode of management may become impatient when they don’t seem to be achieving the results they were aiming for. They may also find it difficult to tolerate failure, which is an essential aspect of experimental understanding. If they try to overcontrol the organization, they will preempt the opportunity for informative patterns to emerge. Leaders who try to impose order in a complex context will fail, but those who set the stage, step back a bit, allow patterns to emerge, and determine which ones are desirable will succeed. They will discern many opportunities for innovation, creativity, and new business models.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Like <a href=\"https://alexchabot.net/2021/12/22/holiday-newsletter.html\">Simon Wardley&rsquo;s maps</a>, the &ldquo;sense-making&rdquo; exercise to map domains and identify where you are helps setting the &ldquo;direction&rdquo; to go towards to achieve the desired results. Unsurprisingly, Snowden and Wardley know each other. Wardley wrote a chapter for the book <a href=\"https://thecynefin.co/library/cynefin-weaving-sense-making-into-the-fabric-of-our-world/\">Cynefin: weaving sense-making into the fabric of our world</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The HBR paper above is a good entry point, so is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_waoADNcaBU\">this video of Snowden</a>.

On a hockey team where the cutoff date is Jan 1 for selection, 40% of players will be from Q1. For young people, months make a big difference on size and ability! They go to UPenn and talk to 75 seniors. <em>Everyone</em> is older than the minimum age, by <em>a lot</em>. Some people are 20 months older than the minimum age. Is there a name for this phenomenon of aggregating a &ldquo;feature&rdquo; too much and losing important info? Aggregation error? They suggest using a formula to compensate or account for the differences within a group.

I knew nearly nothing about anarchism and this was eye-opening. He makes the point that anarchy is based on action, not theory. The various anarchy groups are named based on how they act: anarcho-syndicalists, insurrectionists, anarcho-communists, individualists, and not on their thought leaders, like Marxist-Leninists, or Maoists.   There&rsquo;s also a powerful and scary idea about democracy: it can only exist if there&rsquo;s both a belief that people should have equal rights in making ground decisions <em>and</em> a coercive apparatus to enforce those decisions. In a democracy, one must lose (their election/vote) and the winner&rsquo;s choice must be enforced. Instead, anarchist movements are based on consensus: no one loses. There&rsquo;s no assumption of changing someone&rsquo;s mind. People decide on a common course of action. There are only two forms of disagreement: &ldquo;stand aside&rdquo; or &ldquo;block.&rdquo; The former says &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it and chose not to participate but won&rsquo;t stop anyone from doing it,&rdquo; whereas the latter is a veto arguing the action would violate the reasons for being a group. (That&rsquo;s super interesting: it means in a democracy, someone must lose face. In anarchy, no one does.) He wrote this book early in his career, but you can see elements of future books: <em>Debt</em>, <em>Bullshit Jobs</em>, and <em>The Dawn of Everything</em>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20715796W/Saga?edition=key%3A/books/OL28013370M\"><em>Saga: Compendium one</em></a> by Brian K.

				"content_text": "This is installment #6 of the annual newsletter I share with my colleagues at Enthought (previous years [2021](https://alexchabot.net/2021/12/22/holiday-newsletter.html), [2020](https://alexchabot.net/2020/12/20/holiday-newsletter.html), [2019](https://alexchabot.net/2021/12/17/holiday-newsletter.html), [2018](https://alexchabot.net/2021/12/17/212737.html), and [2017](https://alexchabot.net/2021/12/17/211935.html)).\n\nI *feel* like I consumed less media this year, and yet, *there is so much stuff*! (And even more I didn't include!)\n\nI hope you'll find a good thing or two.\n\nHappy Holidays!\n\n\n## Three things\n\nI've been told a few times: \"your newsletter is amazing, but I haven’t read or watched or listened to anything from it.\" This is my attempt to fix that. If you do only three things, make it these three:\n\n* Listen to *[Partita for 8 Voices](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NDVMtnaB28E)* by Caroline Shaw.\n* Read [Too many needles](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/so/60NWXZixI?languageTag=en#/main) by Oliver Burkeman (author of [Four Thousand Weeks](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/books)). It helped me take a step back from my desire to read *all the things*. This sentence was key: \"After all, you presumably don't feel overwhelmed by all the unread books in the British Library – and not because there aren't an overwhelming number of them, but because it never occurred to you that it might be your job to get through them all.\"\n* Watch [One-Minute Time Machine](https://kottke.org/22/01/one-minute-time-machine), a delightful and surprising short film.\n\n\n## The Big Idea: Cynefin\n\nThe Cynefin framework (kuh-NEV-in) is a framework to make decisions by making sense of the domain you're in: *clear*, *complicated*, *complex*, and *chaotic*. Depending on the domain, the \"right thing to do\" will change. \n\n* The *clear* domain is *known knowns*. Things are stable, causes and effects are clear. It's the world of rules and *best practices*: you acquire data (sense), categorize them, and respond appropriately.\n* In the *complicated* domain, it's *known unknowns*. You don't know the cause-and-effect relationship, but you can figure it out with analysis. You sense, *analyze*, then respond. It's the domain of experts: engineers, lawyers, and surgeons.\n* In the *complex* domain, it's *unknown unknowns*. You figure out the cause and effects after the fact. You must *probe* the system first, sense, then respond. Probes are experiments that are safe to fail. Here are markets, culture, and much of software development.\n* In the *chaotic* domain, cause and effect are… a mess. You  can't take wait to figure out what they are. You must *act* first, then sense and respond. Be quick and decisive. This is crisis management, September 11, and March 2020 and the COVID pandemic. You want to get out of this domain ASAP.\n\nThings go wrong when the approach you chose doesn't match the domain you're in. It would be a valuable framework to convey to clients that want you to take the wrong approach, but teaching it to them is a tall order. Here's a great quote from the HBR paper [A Leader’s Framework for Decision Making](https://hbr.org/2007/11/a-leaders-framework-for-decision-making):\n\n> As in the other contexts, leaders face several challenges in the complex domain. Of primary concern is the temptation to fall back into traditional command-and-control management styles—to demand fail-safe business plans with defined outcomes. Leaders who don’t recognize that a complex domain requires a more experimental mode of management may become impatient when they don’t seem to be achieving the results they were aiming for. They may also find it difficult to tolerate failure, which is an essential aspect of experimental understanding. If they try to overcontrol the organization, they will preempt the opportunity for informative patterns to emerge. Leaders who try to impose order in a complex context will fail, but those who set the stage, step back a bit, allow patterns to emerge, and determine which ones are desirable will succeed. They will discern many opportunities for innovation, creativity, and new business models.\n\nLike [Simon Wardley's maps](https://alexchabot.net/2021/12/22/holiday-newsletter.html), the \"sense-making\" exercise to map domains and identify where you are helps setting the \"direction\" to go towards to achieve the desired results. Unsurprisingly, Snowden and Wardley know each other. Wardley wrote a chapter for the book [Cynefin: weaving sense-making into the fabric of our world](https://thecynefin.co/library/cynefin-weaving-sense-making-into-the-fabric-of-our-world/).\n \nThe HBR paper above is a good entry point, so is [this video of Snowden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_waoADNcaBU). For a software development angle, check out Liz Keogh's [Cynefin for Developers](https://lizkeogh.com/cynefin-for-developers/) and [Estimating Complexity](https://lizkeogh.com/2013/07/21/estimating-complexity/). She also has [a great summary](https://lizkeogh.com/cynefin-for-everyone/). Even Stack Overflow [wrote about Cynefin](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/12/22/best-practices-can-slow-your-application-down/). If you want to dig further, there's a [Cynefin wiki](https://cynefin.io/wiki/Main_Page) and the site of Snowden's company, [The Cynefin Co](https://thecynefin.co/).\n\n\n## Read\n\n[Free Returns Are Complicated, Laborious, and Gross](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/11/free-returns-online-shopping/620169/) by Amanda Mull: I didn't like sending stuff back, now I really don't want to send anything back.\n\n\n[Outliers, Revisited](https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/revisionist-history/outliers-revisited) on Malcolm Gladwell's Revisionist History podcast ([transcript](https://share.descript.com/view/VDS7PW2XdA1)): In schools and in sports, the “best” people in a class or team have the largest \"relative age.\" That's the age difference to the youngest a person can be to join the team or class. On a hockey team where the cutoff date is Jan 1 for selection, 40% of players will be from Q1. For young people, months make a big difference on size and ability! They go to UPenn and talk to 75 seniors. *Everyone* is older than the minimum age, by *a lot*. Some people are 20 months older than the minimum age. Is there a name for this phenomenon of aggregating a \"feature\" too much and losing important info? Aggregation error? They suggest using a formula to compensate or account for the differences within a group. Even though it \"works,\" it feels icky.\n\n[Self Documenting, Interactive Make](https://engineering.specprotected.com/posts/self-documenting-interactive-make/) by Exthoughter Matt Planchard. A wonderful nerdy interactive `make` script with help. Over the top.\n\n[You need to start writing Architecture Decision Records](https://rahulporuri.blogspot.com/2022/10/you-need-to-start-writing-architecture.html) by my colleague Rahul Poruri. Organizations need *decision records* for all big things, not just software. We could adapt [decision journals](https://fs.blog/decision-journal/) for teams. I recently discovered [Loomio](https://www.loomio.com), a tool explicitly designed for collaborative decision-making. It assumes the decision will be made asynchronously by a distributed group of people.\n\n[A tiny CI system](https://www.stchris.net/tiny-ci-system.html) by Christian Ştefănescu. This is a neat little project: self-host a Git server and your own little CI server based on Git post-receive hooks. \n\n[Novelty Search and the Problem with Objectives](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-1770-5_3) [PDF](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~meeden/DevelopmentalRobotics/lehmanNoveltySearch11.pdf) by Joel Lehman and Kenneth O. Stanley:  Optimizing for novelty, not fitting an objective. Relevant to art, creativity, and… science?\n\n[Characterizing people as non-linear 1st order components in software development](https://ameyakarve.wordpress.com/2012/07/22/characterizing-people-as-non-linear-1st-order-components-in-software-development-cockburn-us/) is a 1999 talk by Alistair A.R. Cockburn of the Agile Manifesto. This predates the Agile Manifesto by two years. It's a great telling of the evidence that human factors are the most important predictors of software quality, not technology choices. For an even more fundamental take on this topic, check out [The epistemology of software quality](https://increment.com/teams/the-epistemology-of-software-quality/) by Hillel Wayne.\n\n[Justice Stevens reads the fine print: Matthew Butterick](https://matthewbutterick.com/chron/justice-stevens-reads-the-fine-print.html): Law + typography + David Foster Wallace. \n\n[Contributing to Complex Projects](https://mitchellh.com/writing/contributing-to-complex-projects), a how-to by  Mitchell Hashimoto, founder of HashiCorp. \n\n\n### Architecture, Design, and Urbanism\n\n[Sustainable Apartments – A New Model for the Future by Jeremy McLeod at TEDxStKilda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFJj1v3jmYU): Interesting because of the financial, environmental, and social design of the apartments. They only get ethical investors to buy the site. They interview people for who gets to buy, but they use a lottery to decide who gets to buy which appartment. There's just one bathroom per apartment, no chrome because it's toxic, no tile because it comes from Spain or Italy (it's in Australia). They prioritize social spaces within the building.\n\n[The Bagworm Caterpillar’s DIY Mobile Log Cabin](https://kottke.org/22/04/the-bagworm-caterpillars-diy-mobile-log-cabin): Nature is just incredible.\n\n[The Ugly, Dangerous, and Inefficient Stroads found all over the US & Canada](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ORzNZUeUHAM): will give you a word for the terrible *stroads* of Austin, like Burnet and Airport. \n\n### Books\n\nIt's been a good book-reading year. I think it's due to a good amount of travel and a regular-enough book club. I read books marked with a ♣️ (club, *getit*?) as part of the Enthought book club.\n\n- ♣️ [*No Rules Rules*](!openlibrary.org) by Reed Hastin and Erin Meyer: a fascinating account of how Netflix manages their (creative) organization. Each component taken separately would be unstable or unsustainable in other organizations, from the absence of vacation policy, to the culture of feedback, to the requirements of taking any recruiter's call. Yet, when all implemented together, it creates a solid organization edifice.\n- *[Sourdough](https://worldcat.org/title/968638708)*  by Robin Sloan: A novel about a programmer who gets into baking because of a powerful sourdough starter. I *loved it*.\n- ♣️ [*Are Your Lights On?: How to Figure Out What the Problem Really Is*](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL4802376W/Are_your_lights_on?edition=key%3A/books/OL2229352M) by Donald C. Gause and Gerald M. Weinberg: should be required reading for any consultant. It's *peculiar*, as my colleague said, but the stories are great. Some key lessons. Don't accept someone else's solution as your problem statement. Check if you can change the question if you don't like the answer. Don't solve other people's problems if they can solve them perfectly well. Don't be a *solution problemer*: someone with a solution in search of a problem.\n- ♣️ [*Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity*](https://www.radicalcandor.com) by Kim Scott: coined the term *ruinous empathy*. When being nice is actually damaging. Hit home.\n- [*Bullshit Jobs: A Theory*](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20153626W/Bullshit_Jobs?edition=key%3A/books/OL32062927M) by David Graeber: A bullshit job is pointless for both the company and the individual. He develops an ontology for such jobs: flunkies, box tickers, goons, duct tapers, and taskmasters. It's an incisive and deeply funny analysis of work and working. I loved Chapter 6 on the history of the concept of *time* and labor, and the difficulty of distinguishing between social value and economic value. Recommended.\n- [*The Premonition*](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393881554) by Michael Lewis: Interesting reading this after reading about the Cynefin framework. The pandemic was definitely in the chaos and then complex realm. Charity Dean was a master of dealing with chaos. Carter Mecher somehow managed to turn a complex situation into something complicated. The CDC and the (US) government were doofus, not even acting as if the situation was simple, they were just concerned about optics and saving their own butt. The government really was f'ed up. \n- [*A World Without Email*](https://www.calnewport.com/books/a-world-without-email/) by Cal Newport: Coins the term *Hyperactive Hive Mind*: \"A workflow centered around ongoing conversation fueled by unstructured and unscheduled messages delivered through digital communication tools like email and instant messenger services.\" And the term *Attention Capital Principle*: \"The productivity of the knowledge sector can be significantly increased if we identify workflows that better optimize the human brain’s ability to sustainably add value to information.\" Newport theorizes that the lack of friction in communication is leading to out-of-control feedback loops. A core proposal is to \"seek workflows that (1) minimize mid-task context switches and (2) minimize the sense of communication overload.\" This must be done at the team or organization level. It's hard to solve as an individual.\n- [*The All-Road Bike Revolution*](!openlibrary.org) by Jan Heine: a summary of everything [Bicycle Quarterly](https://www.bikequarterly.com) has learned about bicycles that feel great. I see a new bike in my future.\n- *[Who: The A Method of Hiring by Randy Street and Geoff Smart](https://worldcat.org/title/191922575)*: Presents a rigid framework for recruiting. The full process is long for hiring for technical roles, but seems appropriate when hiring  for leadership and management roles. Makes a big deal of reaching out to *7 references*. Ultimately, the key point is to hire great people, not good people. Echoes * No Rules Rules* and Netflix.\n- [*Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology*](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL5738844W/Fragments_of_an_Anarchist_Anthropology?edition=key%3A/books/OL3312432M) by David Graeber: I wonderful little book I read after Bullshit Jobs. I knew nearly nothing about anarchism and this was eye-opening. He makes the point that anarchy is based on action, not theory. The various anarchy groups are named based on how they act: anarcho-syndicalists, insurrectionists, anarcho-communists, individualists, and not on their thought leaders, like Marxist-Leninists, or Maoists.   There's also a powerful and scary idea about democracy: it can only exist if there's both a belief that people should have equal rights in making ground decisions *and* a coercive apparatus to enforce those decisions. In a democracy, one must lose (their election/vote) and the winner's choice must be enforced. Instead, anarchist movements are based on consensus: no one loses. There's no assumption of changing someone's mind. People decide on a common course of action. There are only two forms of disagreement: \"stand aside\" or \"block.\" The former says \"I don't like it and chose not to participate but won't stop anyone from doing it,\" whereas the latter is a veto arguing the action would violate the reasons for being a group. (That's super interesting: it means in a democracy, someone must lose face. In anarchy, no one does.) He wrote this book early in his career, but you can see elements of future books: *Debt*, *Bullshit Jobs*, and *The Dawn of Everything*.\n- [*Saga: Compendium one*](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20715796W/Saga?edition=key%3A/books/OL28013370M) by Brian K. Vaughan and Fiona Staples: A graphic novel that's *weird*, original, and continually surprising about a couple from two different planets caught in a deadly war. Not family-friendly, but highly recommended.\n- [*How to Begin: Start Doing Something That Matters*](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL28472830M/Start_Something_That_Matters) by Michael Bungay Stanier: a straightforward process for defining and getting started on big personal projects. An easy read.\n- [*Learning to Build*](https://www.learningtobuildbook.com/) by Bob Moesta: a follow-up to Demand-Side Sales, but on the building and prototyping stage. One particular lesson is the use of the [Taguchi Method](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~apte/CV_PRA_TAGUCHI_INTRO.htm) to design experiments and explore a problem space efficiently.\n- [*The Circle*](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL31966711M/The_Circle) by Dave Egger: a dystopian novel about a young woman joining a new all-powerful tech company encouraging everyone to share more about themselves. It was fine but not great.\n- [*In the beginning*](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20035084W/Diane_Arbus?edition=key%3A/books/OL27215125M) by Diane Arbus: photography. I saw her work at [Pier 24](https://pier24.org) in San Francisco and enjoyed it. The book was on sale at BookPeople.\n- [*Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers*](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2482693W/Wabi-sabi_for_artists_designers_poets_philosophers?edition=key%3A/books/OL1079222M) by Leonard Koren: things can be perfectly imperfect.\n- [*Y: The Last Man - Compendium One*](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL26307231W/Y_The_Last_Man_Omnibus?edition=key%3A/books/OL35478513M) by Brian K. Vaughan and Pia Guerra: starts fun and continues to be for maybe three or four books, but then gets contrived and unoriginal.\n- [*Zero to One*](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL25648567M/Zero_to_One) by Peter Thiel: Meh.\n\n## Watch\n\n### Movies\n\n- [Everything Everywhere All at One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Everywhere_All_at_Once) (2022): Just watch it if you haven't! Don't look anything up! My favorite movie of the year. Decade? Life?\n- [Fire of Love (2022)](https://films.nationalgeographic.com/fire-of-love): A documentary about a couple and their love and study of volcanoes. Interesting, funny, moving, and beautiful.\n- [Glass Onion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_Onion:_A_Knives_Out_Mystery) (2022): better than Knives (out)\n- [Parasite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite_%282019_film%29) (2019): Not at all what I was expecting! \"[F]ollows a poor family who scheme to become employed by a wealthy family and infiltrate their household by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.\" Things don't go well.\n\n\n### Online \n\n- [Russ Olsen - To the Moon!](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4Sso4HtvJsw): \tA touching and inspiring talk about how perseverance, belief, leadership, and \"followship\" can make the impossible possible. \n- I have mixed feelings about HBO's Succession. It's a great show about terrible people who are too mean for my taste. But I only have positive feelings about [Succession But It’s Arrested Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ_lM2XKtDo).\n- Tom7's latest ridiculous talk is [Harder Drive: Hard drives we didn't want or need](http://tom7.org/harder/). What's the hardest way to store and retrieve information? By taking advantage of the inherent delay of `ping` calls? In Tetris games? In the drive of discarded electronic covid tests? \t\n- [Stop-motion animation of someone cutting a Lego salmon into sushi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyy-KAMrO3I)\n- [Chris Voss’s Masterclass on The Art of Negotiation](https://www.masterclass.com/classes/chris-voss-teaches-the-art-of-negotiation): excellent teacher. Scarily effective techniques from the former FBI hostage negotiator.\n- [DinosaurJS 2017: Solving Imaginary Scaling Issues, at Scale by Laurie Voss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJByltoGnA8&list=TLGGWntt8YYbf5gyMTEyMjAyMg)\n- [Where Does The Tone Come From In An Electric Guitar?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n02tImce3AE) Eye-opening.\n- [Casino Cheating Expert Reviews Card Counting and Casino Scams From Movies](https://kottke.org/22/02/casino-cheating-expert-reviews-card-counting-and-casino-scams-from-movies)\n- [Mark Adams: Recycling is a defeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=TLGGYzlZ4SoYVNcyMDEyMjAyMg&v=VJ_1EQpQ9j4). Reuse. Best over newest. Not in the talk, but I would add: master the tools you have. \n- [How to Guide Clients through the Shape Up Workflow, with Ryan Singer](https://mobile.twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1mnxedBZzyoJX): Adapting [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) for client work. Great insights from both sides.\n- Kirby Ferguson is back with [Everything is a Remix Part 2](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HhMar_eYnNY), and [Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwxtW1Aio68). My favorite line: \"Genre: a très bon French word.\"\n- [Meet the Liverbirds!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QqLCpXMIw), the story of Britain's first all-female rock 'n' roll band. Like that other band, they came out of Liverpool in the 60s. Part of the New York Times's *Almost Famous* series. It's a great story.\n\t\n\n## Music\n\nI started listening to [Soundfounder](https://kutx.org/shows/soundfounder/), the KUTX show hosted by Andrew Brown, on a regular basis. Half the show is artists I love (and sometimes forget that I love) and the other half is new artists I really enjoy, many of which are from Austin. Two stand-out artists I learned about are [Domi & JD Beck](https://open.spotify.com/album/6cXQ0dxd2pWCTFhZ8RIg2j), and Ross From Friends.\n\n### Modern classical music\n\nI listened to multiple episodes of [Meet the Composer](https://www.newsounds.org/shows/meet-composer), the 2014–2017 radioshow/podcast hosted by Nadia Sirota (of yMusic and Alarm Will Sound). Each episode dives into a single modern classical music composer and is beautifully produced. It's like the Radiolab of modern classical music. Every time I listen to it, I learn of a new artist who makes incredible music and who is off most people's radar. I’m sad the show is no more. The two standout composers were [Andrew Norman](https://www.newsounds.org/story/meet-composer-andrew-norman-story) and [Caroline Shaw](https://www.newsounds.org/story/meet-composer-caroline-shaw-show/). Caroline's work is *stunning*. A lot of her music has been used in TV and movies. Her most famous piece is *[Partita for 8 Voices](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NDVMtnaB28E)*. [*Its Motion Keeps*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0dmTwtx2Ho), written for the Brooklyn Youth Chorus, is another fantastic piece.\n\n### Austin Music\n\nHonestly, I don't love many Austin bands (🙀). I enjoy Spoon, [Balmorhea](https://balmorheamusic.com), and [Grace Pettis](https://www.gracepettis.com) but that's pretty much it. Until this year. Here are six awesome songs.\n\n1. Urban Heat - [HAVE YOU EVER?](https://open.spotify.com/track/6K9FCkVnFLc7Mf89QVf4cR?si=7a2569ffe9b44f71)\n2. Darkbird - [Heartbeat](https://open.spotify.com/track/4salvytkdLfCRwVwI6VEuw?si=0bf035d601464ca4)\n3. [Strawberry Hospital - Azure](https://open.spotify.com/track/5ym34DWOKK0GcBAAplpS3Y): the tags say \"noise, vocaloids\". It reminds me of the strange and interesting pop music coming from Japan.\n4. Sir Woman - [Party Woman](https://open.spotify.com/track/0YYBYLlqoDnn09rZcNF5Ie)\n5. Font - [Sentence I](https://fontmusic.bandcamp.com/album/sentence-i).\n6. B11ce - [Pointillist](https://open.spotify.com/track/72oI9q1E8LHakrezfsG2ZK)\n\n### Other music\n\n[Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/achabotl) tells me I've listened to 11,800+ songs. My most-listened track (29 times, now 31 after writing this) is [You Will Never Work in Television Again](https://open.spotify.com/track/2ownDSIYHvydbtauGZW4ln) by The Smile. I *did* have tickets to go see them in Dallas, but the Universe conspired against us and we didn't go. Oh well. \n\nI collected all my \"liked\" songs in the [2022 playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4sKobhEvZRNy37KZg0XEz9?si=b6b1cdfc98a14aac) (387 songs). Similarly with the [2022 Albums](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1OUAfTe1aD3ZI81Bp1fpHY?si=89f47c278f054270).\n\nI listened to the album [Ultimate Care II](https://open.spotify.com/album/6rUhZEo1ZpJTAc5ssoa0ju?si=BbLzAl5_TbyH2WIb6CDFuw) by Matmos the most. All sounds are recordings of their washing machine. I discovered it on Meet the Composer. I got to see them live. The first two pieces were also made of samples recorded live. It was great.\n\n[San Salvador](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBr5far4KaI) is a voice and percussions ensemble who sings in Occitan, or “langue d’oc” in French. They’re my new favorite band. The rhythm and vocal harmonies are right up my alley. The energy they project in the video linked above is stunning. I hope I get to see them live one day. Their music reminded my of [Barbatuques’ Baianá](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHyzrYBACcg).\n\n[Ephemera](https://ehsangelsi.bandcamp.com/album/ephemera) by Ehsan Gelsi is a strange two-twenty-minute song album composed for the Melbourne Town Hall Grand Organ, Moog, Buchla, analogue electronics and live percussion. Recommended if you like prog rock, even if just a bit.\n\n[Jihye Lee Orchestra - Daring Mind](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0Dn9kePxXvpDbulisRZMIl?si=dg7iv3uWSfGlkbeNVea9Lg): Modern Big Band Jazz. You'll love this if you like Absolute Ensemble, Kevin Eubanks, and Dave Holland's big bands. Modern jazz meets modern classical. She put together a [fantastic jazz big band playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/13u9HkvkaXAgHcOfiHzmLE?si=5f9b2ec4e590492d).\n\nOther great albums:\n\n- [Genesis Owusu - Missing Molars](https://open.spotify.com/album/39wVqebhXLGYGz9ry6xLPe): Sounds like the L.A. groove scene. Not quite hip hop, but also also not not hip hop. Sounds \"like a ton of brick\", as we say in Québec.\n- [Louis Cole - Quality over opinions](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0bRdnqsDRZngsEiT4K8vBE): A new Louis Cole groovy album is always an event.\n- [Harvey Sutherland - Boy](https://open.spotify.com/album/5R4MKy2TupcljTY07AcAWv): very, *very*, funky. For the Vulfpiece, Louis Cole, Jason Collier,and Scary Pockets fans.\n- [Ben Marc - Glass Effect](https://open.spotify.com/album/7aGcbrgSOp6pgTC0AQ1oc6): Electronic, UK hip hop, Bonobo-like\n- [Lisa Leblanc - Chiac Disco](https://open.spotify.com/album/7IXqRgACJ7HBHa1C5dfN8r?si=ba57b3bf1acc4c3a)\n- Archive released two albums this year, [Call to Arms & Angels](https://open.spotify.com/album/3EqSo281BRrMwQ5X5mDYHe?si=XVhPLokBTuOwI__KIctSTQ) and [Super8](https://open.spotify.com/album/27YwkIUsuM03ZV9RbaQ05L?si=jXBzNcKJQyqzFgU2CUfV8w).\n- [Prefuse 73 reads The Books](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3qQ3JeWZXekKqaiFQ1a0BH?si=17edb05bfeb54b61). Like ASMR for my brain. Just the right amount of glitchy loops. \n- [Sylvan Esso - No Rules Sandy](https://open.spotify.com/album/6rl4rzZxECegl9PdYG0hfk)\n- [Kinnship - Commensality (2020)](https://open.spotify.com/album/2aZKjIgTt2BAw8MHpmc8ls) and [Intenserenity (2022)](https://open.spotify.com/album/7jotnJvWpBslYDf4UUyd4l)\n- [Pantha Du Prince - Garden Gaia](https://open.spotify.com/album/1DgRx1LvQ06RX992m1yn5m?si=4e0c7527fa164a6a)\n- [Rival Consoles - Running](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5uPRVmUygYeJZNjyWB48Cy?pt=53e3a7bb37b32a1637f8891ae4ff7e2c)\n- [Shire T – Tomorrow People](https://open.spotify.com/album/0qk4ovxWz0en2H2HIqz2wT?si=2f5ee14ae64145fb): dancy, a little loppy. Wonderful music for programming or cleaning the house. \n- [Weval - Forever](https://open.spotify.com/album/2CKEEhqgIAKmvG6pIdsKq7)\n- [Aquarian - Mutations 1: Death, Taxes & Hanger](https://open.spotify.com/album/5U2IrljnQtrNRWtarbA6vB?si=icwcZYDqRR-LHRLy-lRfBg): Glitchy drum n bass. There's a [part 2](https://open.spotify.com/album/277V1PN4qWSyzYqqY3zAmj?si=EBpFMu6VRcGSf5GIAWh1Kw)\n\n\n- [Keith Jarrett - Bordeaux Concert](https://open.spotify.com/album/4d8HtfvqAmNgjrpCgpA20w): the most-recent improvised solo piano show by the master.\n- [Fleuves - Fleuves](https://open.spotify.com/album/3shA9XeqVNz1XhddE1jDVl?si=BA533qJkQPKQpIvI0iSI7g): bass clarinet, Fender Rhodes, a little Jaga Jazzist-like. Almost no online presence.\n\n## Hardware\n\nA [Stapleless stapler](https://www.jetpens.com/Kokuyo-Harinacs-Stapleless-Stapler-Handy-10-Sheets-Black/pd/25842) for stapling articles to read and annotate. Satisfying.\n\nA USB-rechargeable [plasma lighter](https://www.amazon.com/Rechargeable-Flameless-Windproof-Multi-Safety-Protection/dp/B091CYGJMD/). The fact that it exists boggles my mind.\n\nBuying art (and then framing it, which I have yet to do). I managed to put my hands on two Phlegm prints: [Customary Hats](https://phlegmcomic.myshopify.com/collections/archive/products/customary-hats?variant=37253352849569) and [Civilization II](https://phlegmcomic.myshopify.com/products/civilization-ii?variant=42693982945441). Then there's a stunning black and white infrared photo of a [Twisted Sierra Juniper at Emerald Bay](https://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/.a/6a00df351e888f883402942f9727b5200c-popup) by Ctein. Next up: acquire more wall space.\n\n",

				"content_html": "\n\n<p>This is installment #5 of the annual holiday newsletter I share with my colleagues at Enthought. (<a href=\"https://alexchabot.net/2020/12/20/holiday-newsletter.html\">2020</a>, <a href=\"https://alexchabot.net/2021/12/17/holiday-newsletter.html\">2019</a>, <a href=\"https://alexchabot.net/2021/12/17/212737.html\">2018</a> and <a href=\"https://alexchabot.net/2021/12/17/211935.html\">2017</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Unlike in 2019 and 2020, I didn&rsquo;t keep track of interesting things as the year went by. Big mistake. Nonetheless, I hope you find one or two interesting things below!</p>\n\n<p>Happy holidays to you all, and happy reading/watching/listening!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wardley-maps-seeing-the-future-maybe\">Wardley Maps: Seeing the future, maybe?</h3>\n\n<p>If you’ve talked to me this year, there’s a good chance I talked about <a href=\"https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/02/an-introduction-to-wardley-value-chain.html\">Wardley Maps</a>. It’s a tool for mapping “competitive landscapes.” This means picking a set of users’ needs, breaking them into the value chain of their components, and placing the components on a map based on how far they are from the user’s needs and how evolved they are. One can then make business decisions based on the map. Here’s one <a href=\"https://blog.gardeviance.org\">Simon Wardley</a> made for the photo-sharing business he ran in the early 2000s.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/fa69cc6232.jpg\" alt=\"Wardley Map of a photosharing app.\" title=\"20211221081534-wardley-photo-sharing map.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"699\" height=\"398\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Image from <a href=\"https://medium.com/wardleymaps/finding-a-path-cdb1249078c0\">Simon Wardley&rsquo;s Finding a path</a></em>.</p>\n\n<p>Wardley makes a compelling case for using maps to make decisions. In chess, moving a pawn isn’t a good or a bad move in itself, it all depends on the situation. In war, the flanking move is <em>the</em> move in a particular situation and not in others. In both cases, you use a map to make the decision. Why would business be different?</p>\n\n<p>He goes on to overlay many business and management concepts on top of the maps. Here are a few:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Picking a different development process based on the evolution of the component: Agile for early stages, Lean for products, Six Sigma for commodity.</li>\n<li>Building teams around <em>attitudes</em> to work on different states of evolution. That&rsquo;s the <a href=\"https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/03/on-pioneers-settlers-town-planners-and.html\">Pioneers, Settlers, and Town Planners</a> idea.</li>\n<li>“Context-specific gameplays”: moves one can make when the map is in certain state to accelerate changes. For example open sourcing technologies and data to push a product into a commodity.</li>\n<li>Bundling and unbundling components.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I feel like Wardley stumbled on a Truth of the Universe. Even though it’s likely not to be 100% correct I sure think he’s onto something valuable.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re interested in digging deeper, Wardley wrote a long series of articles that were collated <a href=\"https://learnwardleymapping.com/book/\">into a book</a>. I’m about a third of the way through and it’s excellent. Hat tip to Rahul for pointing me to Wardley’s talk, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek0aWj_rWYs\">Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"2-080-weeks-left\">2,080 Weeks Left</h3>\n\n<p>In August, I added <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/four-thousand-weeks-time-management-for-mortals/9780374159122\"><em>Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals</em></a> to my reading list because Adam Grant, Ryan Holidays, and Austin Kleon recommended it. Then I forgot about it. Then I read <a href=\"https://www.oliverburkeman.com/so/60NWXZixI\">Too many needles</a> by Oliver Burkeman, which 🤯. Why do I stress about reading everything on my reading list(s) but not about reading everything that’s in the British Library? Then I read <a href=\"https://www.oliverburkeman.com/never\">What if you never sort your life out?</a> by Burkeman. Then I read <a href=\"https://www.oliverburkeman.com/onwriting\">How to make writing less hard</a> by Burkeman. Then someone mentioned Four Thousand Weeks <em>by Burkeman</em> and I went <em>Oh</em>. So I read <em>Four Thousand Weeks</em>. If you feel like there’s too much to do and not enough time to do it all, this may be the right book for you (it was for me).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"apenwarr\">Apenwarr</h3>\n\n<p>I can’t remember how I ended up on apenwarr.ca the first time, but every single thing I read was mind opening. The author is Avery Pennarun, co-founder of <a href=\"https://tailscale.com\">Tailscale</a> (and author of <a href=\"https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/subtree/git-subtree.txt\">git-subtree</a>?!). I enjoyed his software engineering simulator series. In <a href=\"https://apenwarr.ca/log/20170831\">SimSWE part 1: Indecisiveness simulator</a>, he makes a strong case for deciding on release goals and then <em>completing them</em>.  In <a href=\"https://apenwarr.ca/log/20170928\">SimSWE part 2: The perils of multitasking</a>, he makes an equally strong point that releasing often brings more value to your users, which he explores again in <a href=\"https://apenwarr.ca/log/20170928\">SimSWE 4: Wants, needs, and chasm-crossing</a>. This time the focus is on shipping first what users need instead of what users want. And then there’s the monstrous and fabulous <a href=\"https://apenwarr.ca/log/20171213\">An epic treatise on scheduling, bug tracking, and triage</a>. It’s too big to summarize, but some key points:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There are echoes of <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/shapeup\">Shape Up</a>: deciding what to build and building it are two separate tracks with different timelines.</li>\n<li>Focus on velocity (in the Agile sense), don’t give people deadlines or goals.</li>\n<li>When writing  User Stories “only things that affect the customer are allowed (in the cycle), because things that don&rsquo;t affect the customer do not deliver value to the customer.”</li>\n<li>Product managements can totally manage users stories in a spreadsheet.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And finally, in <a href=\"https://apenwarr.ca/log/20161226\">Highlights on &ldquo;quality,&rdquo; and Deming&rsquo;s work as it applies to software development</a> Pennarun sent me back towards <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming\">W. Edwards Deming’s</a> work, who was Bob Moesta’s mentor (<a href=\"https://alexchabot.net/2020/12/20/holiday-newsletter.html\">mentioned in the 2020 newsletter</a>). Deming is often considered a father of the Japanese Quality Revolution. Deming is on my 2022 list.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"datasette-redux\">Datasette Redux</h3>\n\n<p>After mentioning it <a href=\"https://alexchabot.net/2020/12/20/holiday-newsletter.html\">last year</a>, I managed to play with Simon Willison’s <a href=\"https://datasette.io\">datasette</a> project. It’s an SQLite-centric tool for “publishing and exploring data”, where you published the data with the code. Simon calls it the “<a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/28/baked-data/\">baked data pattern</a>.” In April, I made a <a href=\"https://ets.alexchabot.net\">code search engine</a> that searches across all ETS repos using the <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-ripgrep\">datasette-ripgrep plugin</a>. The hardest part was, by far, <a href=\"https://alexchabot.net/2021/04/04/publishing-datasette-to.html\">pushing the code to Google Cloud Run</a>. It took me only two months. Later in the year, I played with <a href=\"https://dogsheep.github.io\">dogsheep-beta</a> to build a “personal search engine” built as a collection of SQLite files with a search index implementing the <a href=\"https://2017.djangocon.us/talks/the-denormalized-query-engine-design-pattern/\">denormalized query engine pattern</a>. I don’t have code published for that yet, but it’s been a fun project to collect notes, reading and watching lists, listening histories, location data, and bookmarks in a single searchable interface. In a way, I&rsquo;m competing with <a href=\"https://neeva.com\">Neeva</a> (but I&rsquo;m not going <a href=\"https://github.com/thesephist/monocle\">full-Linus</a>). The next thing I’d like to play with is <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/\">Git scrapping</a> and <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2021/Dec/7/git-history/\">git-history</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mostly-shorter-reads\">(Mostly) Shorter Reads</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Austin Kleon talks about the 13-month <a href=\"https://austinkleon.com/2021/02/05/the-trouble-with-months/\">International Fixed Calendar</a>. It reminds of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date\">ISO week numbers</a> that the Danes love so much. It always weirded me out when they asked “Are you free week 14?” Thinking back, they might have been onto something.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>A trio of articles on the relationship between open source maintainers and the people who use their software. Brett Canon writes <a href=\"https://snarky.ca/the-social-contract-of-open-source/\">The Social Contract of Open Source</a>. Rich Hickey writes <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/richhickey/1563cddea1002958f96e7ba9519972d9\">Open Source is Not About You</a>. And Drew Devault writes <a href=\"https://drewdevault.com/2021/06/14/Provided-as-is-without-warranty.html\">Provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo;, without warranty of any kind</a>.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Dan Lu had many great pieces this year but I particularly liked <a href=\"https://danluu.com/productivity-velocity/\"><em>Some reasons to work on productivity and velocity</em></a>. What resonated with me was the idea that there are “phase changes” in the nature of the work you can tackle as your velocity increases and your feedback loops shorten. With low velocity and long loops, you plan longer because you don’t want to waste an iteration. With high velocity and short loops, new problems become tractable, it’s easier to stay motivated, to stay in the flow. Nearly all the consulting projects we work on aim to achieve that. Do read the whole thing.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Two articles about <em>cybernetics</em>, &ldquo;the science of communications and automatic control systems in both machines and living things” says Wikipedia. (I realized they were linked as I wrote this.) In <a href=\"https://blog.atomist.com/the-origins-of-opera-and-the-future-of-programming/\">Problem-Solving in Music, Art, Science &amp; Software</a>,  Jessica Kerr ties together <em>camerata</em> (groups of people working on a common problem) and cybernetics applied to software development. And in <a href=\"https://subconscious.substack.com/p/notes-are-conversations-across-time\">Notes are conversations across time</a>, Gordon Brander discusses how note-taking is a cybernetic feedback loop between yourself today and your future self. Another thought that crossed my mind while reading was conversations as gradient descent towards shared understanding.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>David Wiley is a big wig in the <em>open educational resources</em> movement. And yet, in <a href=\"https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/6725\"><em>We Should Pause and Ask the Question</em></a> he asks: is openness what we should strive for?  Does “open” really mean increased <em>access</em>? Instead, he suggests evaluating educational resources in terms of their success, scale, and savings for students. For example: “as of March 1, 2021, 985,081 people have enrolled in Python for Everybody on Coursera and […] no one has stood up the tool chain themselves.” He also has this great quote given to him when he was a Shuttleworth Fellow: “don’t let your principles keep you from accomplishing your mission.”</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Ryan Singer published <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/rjs/\">19 short articles</a> on product management, shaping, pattern languages, and usability. They’re all worth a read.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/\">A virtuous cycle for analytics</a> by Jon Udell. A series of articles on providing data to users and mixing Postgres with Python.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Julia Evans on <a href=\"https://jvns.ca/blog/confusing-explanations/\">patterns in confusing explanations</a>.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Chelsea Troy on <a href=\"https://chelseatroy.com/2021/09/14/the-art-of-documentation/\">The Art of Documentation</a>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"books-i-read-this-year\">Books I Read This Year</h3>\n\n<p>I read few books, but thankfully they were great.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://goodbadstrategy.com\">Good Strategy/Bad Strategy</a> by Richard Rumelt. This one made for a delightful and useful book club. Most strategy is bad. It&rsquo;s all fluff, goals, and bad objectives. See for example Simon Wardley’s (him again) <a href=\"https://strategy-madlibs.herokuapp.com\">bad strategy generator</a>. Good strategy has a kernel: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent actions.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/the-art-of-gathering-how-we-meet-and-why-it-matters/9781594634925\">The Art of Gathering: How We Meet and Why It Matters</a> by Priya Parker blew my mind. I got giddy reading it, like when I first read <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/flour-water-salt-yeast-the-fundamentals-of-artisan-bread-and-pizza-a-cookbook-9781607742739/9781607742739\">Flour Water Salt Yeast</a>. I felt like I had put my hands on a truth of the universe that I knew existed but didn’t have a word for, or that someone with super powers wrote a guide for how to be a superhero like them. I keep thinking of how it applies to dinner parties, meetings, and classes. I’ll be re-reading this one.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://creativeselection.io\">Creative Selection</a> by Ken Kocienda. Kocienda was on the small team of people who developed the original software for the iPhone. He was in charge of the keyboard. What struck me the most was Apple&rsquo;s prototyping culture. They <em>build a thing</em> and then critique it. There are no wireframes. It reminded me of Basecamp’s <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/01.1-what-is-getting-real\">Getting Real</a> and more recently, of Jason Fried’s MVP: <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/jason/validation-is-a-mirage-273c0969\">Minimum Viable Pie</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"watching-shorts\">Watching — Shorts</h3>\n\n<p>Most of the videos I end up watching are from the incomparable <a href=\"https://kottke.org\">Jason Kottke</a>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Two Lego-centric videos: In the first, someone builds <a href=\"https://kottke.org/21/11/engineering-a-capable-climbing-lego-car\">a car that can climb obstacles</a>, and in the second, <a href=\"https://kottke.org/21/12/designing-a-lego-car-to-cross-gaps\">the car crosses a gap of increasing length</a>. Watch both until the end for the <em>satisfying</em> bits.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>More Lego. This time <a href=\"https://kottke.org/21/10/mindbending-lego-sculpture\">a flexible plane made out of solid blocks</a>.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://kottke.org/21/08/mesmerizing-matchstick-stop-motion-video\">Mesmerizing Matchstick Stop Motion Video</a>: I’m very patient, but not patient enough to make this if it’s indeed pure stop motion.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://kottke.org/21/09/every-sport-a-bowling-ball\">Every Sport a Bowling Ball</a>. Just what it says on the tin.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Tom7 creates the <a href=\"http://tom7.org/lowercase/\">uppestcase and lowestcase letters</a> by training two deep learning models: one to create uppercase letters from lowercase ones, and the other to create lowercase letters from uppercase ones. Then he pushes things (beyond) their logical conclusions, such as creating lowercase versions of lowercase letters, and uppercase versions of uppercase letters. The results are fonts you can download and “use.” In the process, he builds a lot of really neat custom UIs to visualize what the models are doing. It’s entertaining and interesting.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ5_u8Lgvyk\">Designing and Evaluating Reusable Components</a> by Casey Muratori: I find it fascinating when an expert can externalize their knowledge and doesn’t just bask in expert blindness. Not only can Muratori explain why he thinks some API are good and some not, but he can give you a <em>checklist</em> so you can follow the same thought process. (Thanks Scott M. for the recommendation!)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"watching-longs\">Watching — Longs</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borgen_(TV_series)\">Borgen</a> could be considered a Danish <em>The West Wing</em>. But with better home life scenes, less world drama, more personal drama, more media drama, and more awesome Danish furniture. It’s an interesting story with great acting. It came out while I lived in Denmark and was all the rage then, but didn’t watch it until now.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_(TV_series)\">Rita</a> another Danish series. This one, a mostly light-hearted comedy-drama about a teacher who stands ups for the kids, but is terrible to grown ups. Again, awesome Danish furniture.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_(1926_film)\">The General</a> is a 1926 movie by Buster Keaton. One could call it a 100-year-old blockbuster. Action-packed, funny. On Roger Ebert’s top 10 list.</p>\n\n<p>I watched <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_v_Ferrari\">Ford V. Ferrari</a> at my into-cars friend’s recommendation. I knew nothing about it when I started watching it and enjoyed it until the last few minutes, when something so incredible, so preposterous happened that it changed my entire appreciation of the movie.  Now I <em>love</em> it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bought\">Bought</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>I bought a whetstone years ago but sharpened knives only one or twice a year. This year I read somewhere the story of someone in a similar situation whose brother-in-law (or the likes) said, as he saw him sharpen knives: “Are you planning on becoming a sharpening master or on having your knives in a museum? If not, get a knife sharpener and move on with your life.” So I bought a <a href=\"https://brodandtaylor.com/collections/knife-sharpeners\">refurbished knife sharpener from Brod &amp; Taylor</a>. It’s <em>awesome</em> and now we have sharp knives every day.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Our house-purchasing process took 7 months and it was traumatic. But thankfully, memory is a faculty that forgets. In the end, I say it was worth it for us.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Anna and I went to Big Bend in March (which was great!). About a mile from the parking lot, my “normal” hiking boots started to hurt my ankle so Anna, my hero, dropped her backpack, took my boots and went back to the car to bring back her and my pair of not-made-for hiking Vivobarefoot boots. We went our merry way without pain for the rest of the 3-day hike and both bought a pair of <a href=\"https://www.vivobarefoot.com/us/tracker-ii-fg-mens?colour=Bracken\">Trackers</a> the day we came back to Austin. They’re amazing.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"quick-hits\">Quick Hits</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/interactive/the-ultimate-texas-tacopedia/\">The Ultimate Texas Tacopedia</a> by Texas Monthly.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://kottke.org/21/05/the-worlds-most-beautiful-gas-stations\">The World’s Most Beautiful Gas Stations</a></p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://kottke.org/21/07/minimalist-creative-funny-photography\">Minimalist Creative Funny Photography</a></p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://kottke.org/21/01/hey-lets-watch-jacques-pepin-fry-eggs\">Hey, Let’s Watch Jacques Pépin Fry Eggs</a> with a fork in a non-stick pan!</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Follow a drop of water as it makes its way to the ocean with <a href=\"https://river-runner.samlearner.com/\">River Runner</a>.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://kinopio.club\">Kinopio</a> is a quirky and surprisingly powerful alternative to visual thinking tools like Jamboard, Miro, or Whimsical. It&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://pketh.org/how-kinopio-is-made.html\">built as</a> a single 150kb Vue.js client-side file. The server backend component is only involved in backups and syncing. It’s developed by <a href=\"https://pketh.org/\">@pketh</a>, co-creator of Glitch. He writes a weird and interesting blog.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"music\">Music</h3>\n\n<p>I listened to more than 43,400 minutes of music by about 1,460 artists across 161 genres (says Spotify). TOBACCO was the artist I listened to the most. I must have been in a weird groove at the beginning of the year because I listened to the album <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/4AwRfUkwwP6h8QSMl1Fzpt?si=EM2ZZ93eSzakbSG2qu88Ow\">Hot Wet &amp; Sassy</a> 26 times.</p>\n\n<p>Every album I enjoyed this year is <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3RzXqQedYkH48qdjO5cENz?si=8e511a4e72cd42ec\">in a playlist</a>, but here&rsquo;s a short list of outstanding albums:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shire T - <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/1dDsbruFq4OZMM1Xj3KF6v\">London. Paris. Berlin</a>, and <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/0qk4ovxWz0en2H2HIqz2wT\">Tomorrow&rsquo;s People</a> (half of Maribou State). Tomorrow&rsquo;s People may be my favorite album of 2021. It&rsquo;s so dancey, so happy.</li>\n<li>Sylvan Esso - <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/2KAPJ40On8JY1Yt64JJgTk\">Free Love</a>: First post-pandemic concert in September at the new Moody Amphitheater. I had forgotten that people sing along.</li>\n<li>Alessandro Cortini - <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/045jhBuqmI4EXPrtKY3RbD\">SCURO CHIARO</a>: Also a member of Nine Inch Nails, Cortini makes perfectly ambient, loopy, enveloping synthesizer music.</li>\n<li>Clay and Friends - <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/7lrzhKzQST8GyHoR7MAsiG\">La Musica Popular of Verdun</a> : A Montréal-based band making music as if they were Manu Chao driving down an L.A. freeway (Verdun is a part of Montréal). Mixes English, French and Spanish.</li>\n<li>voljum - <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/4hsBJrb0nfKNipRlK7Hvdi\">dayscapes</a>: Most of the songs are like if a big band stepped into the Spider-verse where they first turn into Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood, then into Amon Tobin-as-Two-Fingers for a bit, followed by a brief stint as Jamiroquai before the big band returns to the normal world. I dig it.</li>\n<li>Arca released 4 albums this year (!), Kick II, Kick III, Kick IIII, and Kick IIIII. <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/4DbRtnuP6eyQSGXbquLRv0\">Kick III</a> is the only one I&rsquo;ve had the change to listen to multiple times and it&rsquo;s&hellip; hard to describe. Do use good headphones or a subwoofer.</li>\n<li>Aufgang - <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/4BKGq4celpHoOLmcJVLFgb\">Broad Ways</a>: Another loopy piano trio that mixes electronics with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_piano\">prepared piano</a>. In the same family as Grandbrothers and GoGo Penguin.</li>\n<li>Cid Rim  - <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/435R1bfZZFPEIpQwHaFLVt\">Songs of Vienna</a>.</li>\n<li>Current Value - <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/0bTcRkYe5mxpiH2GTb65n7?si=5_de6uZjR8iUvhbEJXkiow\">The All Attracting</a> as well as many singles and EP. When you see me bobbing my head intently at my desk, there&rsquo;s a good chance I&rsquo;m listening to this intense drum &lsquo;n bass.</li>\n<li>Speaking of drum &lsquo;n bass, I had the chance to see Noisia <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/3bNBUPpEM4KrC7LuOUUalb?si=dj0GJhbfQ9GF7HVxHh6CDA\">live in Austin November</a>. Gosh, I missed concerts.</li>\n<li>Rezz - <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/59d750ai99PfyZ5zTUQWfY\">Spiral</a>: Another really heavy bass album. Not good brunch music.</li>\n<li>Hubert Lenoir - <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/5mAkGDBxvG3ZvwvVOBWLNu\">PICTURA DE IPSE</a>: A darling of the Québec indie scene. Of many strange albums on this list, this may be the strangest.</li>\n<li>Jean Louis Cormier - <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/6jjFXEMWjC8uFPyp9cUlQX\">Le ciel est au planché</a>: A solid 2nd pandemic album, even though I don&rsquo;t like it as much as last year&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/3TxGclPeiNgoHdw5jIUXuo?si=nkTBx0YkSzmCG6HptXyBVQ\">Quand la nuit tombe</a>.</li>\n<li>Jaga Jazzist - <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/4M2fF5bRBP8Gi5Bi2EccFg\">The Tower</a>: The latest album from what may be my all-time favorite band.

I have a hard time describing his styles but I enjoy his voice.</li>\n<li>Julien Mier - <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/11ICV9EGdUbORNIVNTqyUB?si=NQW09pFCS6GyOJ7fVd58pg\">Industry in the trees</a>: makes glitchy music that cheers me up.</li>\n<li>LITE - <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/1vCvdwH7jZPfoYZ690ClIW?si=sH9_uV2fT_2kQxUXCuJgUA\">Fraction</a>: An album of remixes of this influential Japanese math rock band. <a href=\"https://daily.bandcamp.com/lists/lite-discography-list\">Bandcamp had a great write up of their history and discography</a>. Their whole discography is worth a listen. This is Alex catnip.</li>\n<li>KUNZITE - <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/0zoanXJYpaFO0jND1HzAti\">VISUALS</a>: Somewhere on the spectrum between Unknown Mortal Orchestra and El Ten Eleven, but with more energy than both.</li>\n<li>Laura Mvula - <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/1VQO9qF4W5tCsMfwDYh5FU\">Pink Noise</a>.</li>\n<li>Noname - <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/18Scpsg5OV1iYNtSaCsjwz\">Telefone</a>: A little like Lauren Hill, with a little bit more electronics and smooth sounds.</li>\n<li>Mieux - <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/6GWCEHteTYQmObC8r1iD70\">Rulers</a>: Some loopy music, sometimes with electronics, sometimes with guitars.

				"content_text": "This is installment #5 of the annual holiday newsletter I share with my colleagues at Enthought. ([2020](https://alexchabot.net/2020/12/20/holiday-newsletter.html), [2019](https://alexchabot.net/2021/12/17/holiday-newsletter.html), [2018](https://alexchabot.net/2021/12/17/212737.html) and [2017](https://alexchabot.net/2021/12/17/211935.html)). \n\nUnlike in 2019 and 2020, I didn't keep track of interesting things as the year went by. Big mistake. Nonetheless, I hope you find one or two interesting things below!\n\nHappy holidays to you all, and happy reading/watching/listening!\n\n\n### Wardley Maps: Seeing the future, maybe?\n\nIf you’ve talked to me this year, there’s a good chance I talked about [Wardley Maps](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/02/an-introduction-to-wardley-value-chain.html). It’s a tool for mapping “competitive landscapes.” This means picking a set of users’ needs, breaking them into the value chain of their components, and placing the components on a map based on how far they are from the user’s needs and how evolved they are. One can then make business decisions based on the map. Here’s one [Simon Wardley](https://blog.gardeviance.org) made for the photo-sharing business he ran in the early 2000s.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/fa69cc6232.jpg\" alt=\"Wardley Map of a photosharing app.\" title=\"20211221081534-wardley-photo-sharing map.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"699\" height=\"398\" />\n\n*Image from [Simon Wardley's Finding a path](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/finding-a-path-cdb1249078c0)*.\n\nWardley makes a compelling case for using maps to make decisions. In chess, moving a pawn isn’t a good or a bad move in itself, it all depends on the situation. In war, the flanking move is *the* move in a particular situation and not in others. In both cases, you use a map to make the decision. Why would business be different?\n\nHe goes on to overlay many business and management concepts on top of the maps. Here are a few:\n\n* Picking a different development process based on the evolution of the component: Agile for early stages, Lean for products, Six Sigma for commodity.\n* Building teams around *attitudes* to work on different states of evolution. That's the [Pioneers, Settlers, and Town Planners](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/03/on-pioneers-settlers-town-planners-and.html) idea.\n* “Context-specific gameplays”: moves one can make when the map is in certain state to accelerate changes. For example open sourcing technologies and data to push a product into a commodity.\n* Bundling and unbundling components.\n\nI feel like Wardley stumbled on a Truth of the Universe. Even though it’s likely not to be 100% correct I sure think he’s onto something valuable.\n\nIf you’re interested in digging deeper, Wardley wrote a long series of articles that were collated [into a book](https://learnwardleymapping.com/book/). I’m about a third of the way through and it’s excellent. Hat tip to Rahul for pointing me to Wardley’s talk, [Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek0aWj_rWYs).\n\n### 2,080 Weeks Left\n\nIn August, I added [*Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals*](https://bookshop.org/books/four-thousand-weeks-time-management-for-mortals/9780374159122) to my reading list because Adam Grant, Ryan Holidays, and Austin Kleon recommended it. Then I forgot about it. Then I read [Too many needles](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/so/60NWXZixI) by Oliver Burkeman, which 🤯. Why do I stress about reading everything on my reading list(s) but not about reading everything that’s in the British Library? Then I read [What if you never sort your life out?](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/never) by Burkeman. Then I read [How to make writing less hard](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/onwriting) by Burkeman. Then someone mentioned Four Thousand Weeks *by Burkeman* and I went *Oh*. So I read *Four Thousand Weeks*. If you feel like there’s too much to do and not enough time to do it all, this may be the right book for you (it was for me).\n\n### Apenwarr\n\nI can’t remember how I ended up on apenwarr.ca the first time, but every single thing I read was mind opening. The author is Avery Pennarun, co-founder of [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) (and author of [git-subtree](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/subtree/git-subtree.txt)?!). I enjoyed his software engineering simulator series. In [SimSWE part 1: Indecisiveness simulator](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20170831), he makes a strong case for deciding on release goals and then *completing them*.  In [SimSWE part 2: The perils of multitasking](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20170928), he makes an equally strong point that releasing often brings more value to your users, which he explores again in [SimSWE 4: Wants, needs, and chasm-crossing](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20170928). This time the focus is on shipping first what users need instead of what users want. And then there’s the monstrous and fabulous [An epic treatise on scheduling, bug tracking, and triage](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20171213). It’s too big to summarize, but some key points:\n\n* There are echoes of [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup): deciding what to build and building it are two separate tracks with different timelines.\n* Focus on velocity (in the Agile sense), don’t give people deadlines or goals.\n* When writing  User Stories “only things that affect the customer are allowed (in the cycle), because things that don't affect the customer do not deliver value to the customer.”\n* Product managements can totally manage users stories in a spreadsheet.\n\nAnd finally, in [Highlights on \"quality,\" and Deming's work as it applies to software development](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20161226) Pennarun sent me back towards [W. Edwards Deming’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming) work, who was Bob Moesta’s mentor ([mentioned in the 2020 newsletter](https://alexchabot.net/2020/12/20/holiday-newsletter.html)). Deming is often considered a father of the Japanese Quality Revolution. Deming is on my 2022 list.\n\n### Datasette Redux\n\nAfter mentioning it [last year](https://alexchabot.net/2020/12/20/holiday-newsletter.html), I managed to play with Simon Willison’s [datasette](https://datasette.io) project. It’s an SQLite-centric tool for “publishing and exploring data”, where you published the data with the code. Simon calls it the “[baked data pattern](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/28/baked-data/).” In April, I made a [code search engine](https://ets.alexchabot.net) that searches across all ETS repos using the [datasette-ripgrep plugin](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-ripgrep). The hardest part was, by far, [pushing the code to Google Cloud Run](https://alexchabot.net/2021/04/04/publishing-datasette-to.html). It took me only two months. Later in the year, I played with [dogsheep-beta](https://dogsheep.github.io) to build a “personal search engine” built as a collection of SQLite files with a search index implementing the [denormalized query engine pattern](https://2017.djangocon.us/talks/the-denormalized-query-engine-design-pattern/). I don’t have code published for that yet, but it’s been a fun project to collect notes, reading and watching lists, listening histories, location data, and bookmarks in a single searchable interface. In a way, I'm competing with [Neeva](https://neeva.com) (but I'm not going [full-Linus](https://github.com/thesephist/monocle)). The next thing I’d like to play with is [Git scrapping](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/) and [git-history](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Dec/7/git-history/).\n\n\n### (Mostly) Shorter Reads\n\n* Austin Kleon talks about the 13-month [International Fixed Calendar](https://austinkleon.com/2021/02/05/the-trouble-with-months/). It reminds of the [ISO week numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) that the Danes love so much. It always weirded me out when they asked “Are you free week 14?” Thinking back, they might have been onto something.\n\n* A trio of articles on the relationship between open source maintainers and the people who use their software. Brett Canon writes [The Social Contract of Open Source](https://snarky.ca/the-social-contract-of-open-source/). Rich Hickey writes [Open Source is Not About You](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/1563cddea1002958f96e7ba9519972d9). And Drew Devault writes [Provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind](https://drewdevault.com/2021/06/14/Provided-as-is-without-warranty.html).\n\n* Dan Lu had many great pieces this year but I particularly liked [*Some reasons to work on productivity and velocity*](https://danluu.com/productivity-velocity/). What resonated with me was the idea that there are “phase changes” in the nature of the work you can tackle as your velocity increases and your feedback loops shorten. With low velocity and long loops, you plan longer because you don’t want to waste an iteration. With high velocity and short loops, new problems become tractable, it’s easier to stay motivated, to stay in the flow. Nearly all the consulting projects we work on aim to achieve that. Do read the whole thing.\n\n* Two articles about *cybernetics*, \"the science of communications and automatic control systems in both machines and living things” says Wikipedia. (I realized they were linked as I wrote this.) In [Problem-Solving in Music, Art, Science & Software](https://blog.atomist.com/the-origins-of-opera-and-the-future-of-programming/),  Jessica Kerr ties together *camerata* (groups of people working on a common problem) and cybernetics applied to software development. And in [Notes are conversations across time](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/notes-are-conversations-across-time), Gordon Brander discusses how note-taking is a cybernetic feedback loop between yourself today and your future self. Another thought that crossed my mind while reading was conversations as gradient descent towards shared understanding.\n\n* David Wiley is a big wig in the *open educational resources* movement. And yet, in [*We Should Pause and Ask the Question*](https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/6725) he asks: is openness what we should strive for?  Does “open” really mean increased *access*? Instead, he suggests evaluating educational resources in terms of their success, scale, and savings for students. For example: “as of March 1, 2021, 985,081 people have enrolled in Python for Everybody on Coursera and […] no one has stood up the tool chain themselves.” He also has this great quote given to him when he was a Shuttleworth Fellow: “don’t let your principles keep you from accomplishing your mission.”\n\n* Ryan Singer published [19 short articles](https://world.hey.com/rjs/) on product management, shaping, pattern languages, and usability. They’re all worth a read.\n\n* [A virtuous cycle for analytics](https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/) by Jon Udell. A series of articles on providing data to users and mixing Postgres with Python.\n\n* Julia Evans on [patterns in confusing explanations](https://jvns.ca/blog/confusing-explanations/).\n\n* Chelsea Troy on [The Art of Documentation](https://chelseatroy.com/2021/09/14/the-art-of-documentation/).\n\n### Books I Read This Year\n\nI read few books, but thankfully they were great.\n\n[Good Strategy/Bad Strategy](http://goodbadstrategy.com) by Richard Rumelt. This one made for a delightful and useful book club. Most strategy is bad. It's all fluff, goals, and bad objectives. See for example Simon Wardley’s (him again) [bad strategy generator](https://strategy-madlibs.herokuapp.com). Good strategy has a kernel: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent actions.\n\n[The Art of Gathering: How We Meet and Why It Matters](https://bookshop.org/books/the-art-of-gathering-how-we-meet-and-why-it-matters/9781594634925) by Priya Parker blew my mind. I got giddy reading it, like when I first read [Flour Water Salt Yeast](https://bookshop.org/books/flour-water-salt-yeast-the-fundamentals-of-artisan-bread-and-pizza-a-cookbook-9781607742739/9781607742739). I felt like I had put my hands on a truth of the universe that I knew existed but didn’t have a word for, or that someone with super powers wrote a guide for how to be a superhero like them. I keep thinking of how it applies to dinner parties, meetings, and classes. I’ll be re-reading this one.\n\n[Creative Selection](http://creativeselection.io) by Ken Kocienda. Kocienda was on the small team of people who developed the original software for the iPhone. He was in charge of the keyboard. What struck me the most was Apple's prototyping culture. They *build a thing* and then critique it. There are no wireframes. It reminded me of Basecamp’s [Getting Real](https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/01.1-what-is-getting-real) and more recently, of Jason Fried’s MVP: [Minimum Viable Pie](https://world.hey.com/jason/validation-is-a-mirage-273c0969).\n\n\n### Watching — Shorts\nMost of the videos I end up watching are from the incomparable [Jason Kottke](https://kottke.org). \n\n* Two Lego-centric videos: In the first, someone builds [a car that can climb obstacles](https://kottke.org/21/11/engineering-a-capable-climbing-lego-car), and in the second, [the car crosses a gap of increasing length](https://kottke.org/21/12/designing-a-lego-car-to-cross-gaps). Watch both until the end for the *satisfying* bits.\n\n* More Lego. This time [a flexible plane made out of solid blocks](https://kottke.org/21/10/mindbending-lego-sculpture).\n\n* [Mesmerizing Matchstick Stop Motion Video](https://kottke.org/21/08/mesmerizing-matchstick-stop-motion-video): I’m very patient, but not patient enough to make this if it’s indeed pure stop motion.\n\n* [Every Sport a Bowling Ball](https://kottke.org/21/09/every-sport-a-bowling-ball). Just what it says on the tin.\n\n* Tom7 creates the [uppestcase and lowestcase letters](http://tom7.org/lowercase/) by training two deep learning models: one to create uppercase letters from lowercase ones, and the other to create lowercase letters from uppercase ones. Then he pushes things (beyond) their logical conclusions, such as creating lowercase versions of lowercase letters, and uppercase versions of uppercase letters. The results are fonts you can download and “use.” In the process, he builds a lot of really neat custom UIs to visualize what the models are doing. It’s entertaining and interesting.\n\n* [Designing and Evaluating Reusable Components](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ5_u8Lgvyk) by Casey Muratori: I find it fascinating when an expert can externalize their knowledge and doesn’t just bask in expert blindness. Not only can Muratori explain why he thinks some API are good and some not, but he can give you a *checklist* so you can follow the same thought process. (Thanks Scott M. for the recommendation!)\n\n### Watching — Longs\n\n[Borgen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borgen_(TV_series)) could be considered a Danish *The West Wing*. But with better home life scenes, less world drama, more personal drama, more media drama, and more awesome Danish furniture. It’s an interesting story with great acting. It came out while I lived in Denmark and was all the rage then, but didn’t watch it until now. \n\n[Rita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_(TV_series)) another Danish series. This one, a mostly light-hearted comedy-drama about a teacher who stands ups for the kids, but is terrible to grown ups. Again, awesome Danish furniture.\n\n[The General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_(1926_film)) is a 1926 movie by Buster Keaton. One could call it a 100-year-old blockbuster. Action-packed, funny. On Roger Ebert’s top 10 list.\n\nI watched [Ford V. Ferrari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_v_Ferrari) at my into-cars friend’s recommendation. I knew nothing about it when I started watching it and enjoyed it until the last few minutes, when something so incredible, so preposterous happened that it changed my entire appreciation of the movie.  Now I *love* it.\n\n### Bought\n\n* I bought a whetstone years ago but sharpened knives only one or twice a year. This year I read somewhere the story of someone in a similar situation whose brother-in-law (or the likes) said, as he saw him sharpen knives: “Are you planning on becoming a sharpening master or on having your knives in a museum? If not, get a knife sharpener and move on with your life.” So I bought a [refurbished knife sharpener from Brod & Taylor](https://brodandtaylor.com/collections/knife-sharpeners). It’s *awesome* and now we have sharp knives every day.\n\n* Our house-purchasing process took 7 months and it was traumatic. But thankfully, memory is a faculty that forgets. In the end, I say it was worth it for us.\n\n* Anna and I went to Big Bend in March (which was great!). About a mile from the parking lot, my “normal” hiking boots started to hurt my ankle so Anna, my hero, dropped her backpack, took my boots and went back to the car to bring back her and my pair of not-made-for hiking Vivobarefoot boots. We went our merry way without pain for the rest of the 3-day hike and both bought a pair of [Trackers](https://www.vivobarefoot.com/us/tracker-ii-fg-mens?colour=Bracken) the day we came back to Austin. They’re amazing.\n\n### Quick Hits\n\n* [The Ultimate Texas Tacopedia](https://www.texasmonthly.com/interactive/the-ultimate-texas-tacopedia/) by Texas Monthly.\n\n* [The World’s Most Beautiful Gas Stations](https://kottke.org/21/05/the-worlds-most-beautiful-gas-stations)\n\n* [Minimalist Creative Funny Photography](https://kottke.org/21/07/minimalist-creative-funny-photography)\n\n* [Hey, Let’s Watch Jacques Pépin Fry Eggs](https://kottke.org/21/01/hey-lets-watch-jacques-pepin-fry-eggs) with a fork in a non-stick pan!\n\n* Follow a drop of water as it makes its way to the ocean with [River Runner](https://river-runner.samlearner.com/).\n\n* [Kinopio](https://kinopio.club) is a quirky and surprisingly powerful alternative to visual thinking tools like Jamboard, Miro, or Whimsical. It's [built as](https://pketh.org/how-kinopio-is-made.html) a single 150kb Vue.js client-side file. The server backend component is only involved in backups and syncing. It’s developed by [@pketh](https://pketh.org/), co-creator of Glitch. He writes a weird and interesting blog.\n\n### Music\n\nI listened to more than 43,400 minutes of music by about 1,460 artists across 161 genres (says Spotify). TOBACCO was the artist I listened to the most. I must have been in a weird groove at the beginning of the year because I listened to the album [Hot Wet & Sassy](https://open.spotify.com/album/4AwRfUkwwP6h8QSMl1Fzpt?si=EM2ZZ93eSzakbSG2qu88Ow) 26 times.\n\nEvery album I enjoyed this year is [in a playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3RzXqQedYkH48qdjO5cENz?si=8e511a4e72cd42ec), but here's a short list of outstanding albums:\n\n- Shire T - [London. Paris. Berlin](https://open.spotify.com/album/1dDsbruFq4OZMM1Xj3KF6v), and [Tomorrow's People](https://open.spotify.com/album/0qk4ovxWz0en2H2HIqz2wT) (half of Maribou State). Tomorrow's People may be my favorite album of 2021. It's so dancey, so happy. \n- Sylvan Esso - [Free Love](https://open.spotify.com/album/2KAPJ40On8JY1Yt64JJgTk): First post-pandemic concert in September at the new Moody Amphitheater. I had forgotten that people sing along.\n- Alessandro Cortini - [SCURO CHIARO](https://open.spotify.com/album/045jhBuqmI4EXPrtKY3RbD): Also a member of Nine Inch Nails, Cortini makes perfectly ambient, loopy, enveloping synthesizer music.\n- Clay and Friends - [La Musica Popular of Verdun](https://open.spotify.com/album/7lrzhKzQST8GyHoR7MAsiG) : A Montréal-based band making music as if they were Manu Chao driving down an L.A. freeway (Verdun is a part of Montréal). Mixes English, French and Spanish.\n- voljum - [dayscapes](https://open.spotify.com/album/4hsBJrb0nfKNipRlK7Hvdi): Most of the songs are like if a big band stepped into the Spider-verse where they first turn into Medeski, Martin & Wood, then into Amon Tobin-as-Two-Fingers for a bit, followed by a brief stint as Jamiroquai before the big band returns to the normal world. I dig it.\n- Arca released 4 albums this year (!), Kick II, Kick III, Kick IIII, and Kick IIIII. [Kick III](https://open.spotify.com/track/4DbRtnuP6eyQSGXbquLRv0) is the only one I've had the change to listen to multiple times and it's... hard to describe. Do use good headphones or a subwoofer.\n- Aufgang - [Broad Ways](https://open.spotify.com/album/4BKGq4celpHoOLmcJVLFgb): Another loopy piano trio that mixes electronics with [prepared piano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_piano). In the same family as Grandbrothers and GoGo Penguin.\n- Cid Rim  - [Songs of Vienna](https://open.spotify.com/album/435R1bfZZFPEIpQwHaFLVt).\n- Current Value - [The All Attracting](https://open.spotify.com/album/0bTcRkYe5mxpiH2GTb65n7?si=5_de6uZjR8iUvhbEJXkiow) as well as many singles and EP. When you see me bobbing my head intently at my desk, there's a good chance I'm listening to this intense drum 'n bass.\n- Speaking of drum 'n bass, I had the chance to see Noisia [live in Austin November](https://open.spotify.com/album/3bNBUPpEM4KrC7LuOUUalb?si=dj0GJhbfQ9GF7HVxHh6CDA). Gosh, I missed concerts.\n- Rezz - [Spiral](https://open.spotify.com/album/59d750ai99PfyZ5zTUQWfY): Another really heavy bass album. Not good brunch music.\n- Hubert Lenoir - [PICTURA DE IPSE](https://open.spotify.com/album/5mAkGDBxvG3ZvwvVOBWLNu): A darling of the Québec indie scene. Of many strange albums on this list, this may be the strangest.\n- Jean Louis Cormier - [Le ciel est au planché](https://open.spotify.com/album/6jjFXEMWjC8uFPyp9cUlQX): A solid 2nd pandemic album, even though I don't like it as much as last year's [Quand la nuit tombe](https://open.spotify.com/album/3TxGclPeiNgoHdw5jIUXuo?si=nkTBx0YkSzmCG6HptXyBVQ).\n- Jaga Jazzist - [The Tower](https://open.spotify.com/album/4M2fF5bRBP8Gi5Bi2EccFg): The latest album from what may be my all-time favorite band. This 10-piece Norwegian group gives incredible concerts.\n- José James: [No beginning no end 2](https://open.spotify.com/album/1dwWH4m6TIepflnji3hVsG), [New York 2020 (Live)](https://open.spotify.com/album/4z6b0ZmaN4kbV0vg526hon), and even a Christmas music album, [Merry Christmas from José James](https://open.spotify.com/album/4bcdBu4Vjwu1J0GGs7HU72?si=indIKABYQzOZyhR6_40JsQ): R&B meets hip hop meets blues meets crooner meets late night jazz trio. I have a hard time describing his styles but I enjoy his voice.\n- Julien Mier - [Industry in the trees](https://open.spotify.com/album/11ICV9EGdUbORNIVNTqyUB?si=NQW09pFCS6GyOJ7fVd58pg): makes glitchy music that cheers me up.\n- LITE - [Fraction](https://open.spotify.com/album/1vCvdwH7jZPfoYZ690ClIW?si=sH9_uV2fT_2kQxUXCuJgUA): An album of remixes of this influential Japanese math rock band. [Bandcamp had a great write up of their history and discography](https://daily.bandcamp.com/lists/lite-discography-list). Their whole discography is worth a listen. This is Alex catnip. \n- KUNZITE - [VISUALS](https://open.spotify.com/album/0zoanXJYpaFO0jND1HzAti): Somewhere on the spectrum between Unknown Mortal Orchestra and El Ten Eleven, but with more energy than both.\n- Laura Mvula - [Pink Noise](https://open.spotify.com/album/1VQO9qF4W5tCsMfwDYh5FU).\n- Noname - [Telefone](https://open.spotify.com/album/18Scpsg5OV1iYNtSaCsjwz): A little like Lauren Hill, with a little bit more electronics and smooth sounds.\n- Mieux - [Rulers](https://open.spotify.com/album/6GWCEHteTYQmObC8r1iD70): Some loopy music, sometimes with electronics, sometimes with guitars. You'll like it if you like Steve Reich or The Field.\n- Tangents - [Timeslip & Chimeras](https://open.spotify.com/album/3so5da4nu96kLa2tndnJ0u): Mostly acoustic ambient \"jazz,\" reminiscent of Pantha du Prince and Dawn of Midi.\n",

				"title": "Lessons Learned During My PhD",
				"content_html": "\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I shared these notes with my friends and colleagues at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) when I finished my PhD in December 2015.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here are things that I either learned during my PhD, or that helped me get through it. I in no way have all the answers, but there are a few things that helped me that I think would be helpful to other people as well.</p>\n\n<p>I split the content in six different sections, meta-things, writing, reading, speaking, programming, and mind and body. I included links to articles, books, and tools that are related to each section.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"meta\">Meta</h2>\n\n<p>The main recommendation here is to have a system to deal with all the things you have to do and the things you want to do. I personally used the GTD method, which stands for <a href=\"https://gettingthingsdone.com\">Getting Things Done</a>. I highly recommend getting the latest book. You can find it <a href=\"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&amp;title=&amp;lang=en&amp;isbn=0143126563&amp;destination=dk&amp;currency=DKK&amp;mode=basic&amp;st=sr&amp;ac=qr\">delivered at your desk for 100 kr</a>. The main ideas of the system are: everything goes in an inbox (physical and/or on a computer). Periodically, process the inbox and decide if you&rsquo;ll do the thing, trash it, or store it in your reference system. &ldquo;Tasks&rdquo; that require more than two action are considered projects, and a project consist of a list of <em>physical</em>, <em>actionable</em> actions. The other important thing about GTD is that it includes a weekly review of all the projects in your system, as well as your calendar and other active things in your life. I learned about this almost 10 years ago now<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:gtd\"><a href=\"#fn:gtd\">1</a></sup> and I would go as far as to say that it changed my life.</p>\n\n<p>There are many applications designed to implement the GTD system. On the Mac, there&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/\">OmniFocus</a>, <a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.taskpaper.com\">TaskPaper</a> (<em>really worth checking</em>). <a href=\"https://todoist.com\">Todoist</a> is multi-platform.</p>\n\n<p>I also recommend reading <a href=\"https://gettingresults.com\"><em>Getting Results the Agile Way</em>, by J.D. Meier</a>, which proposes a different take on selecting <em>what</em> you should work in. The basic idea is to pick 3 things to focus on every day, three per week, three per month, and three per year. The things you do every day should go towards you weekly goals, etc. The <a href=\"https://gettingresults.com\">Asian Efficiency</a> blog (weird name, I know), is a good noise-free resource about that kind of material (check the &ldquo;specialty topics&rdquo; in the sidebar).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"make-checklists\">Make checklists</h3>\n\n<p>Keep checklists for processes and things you do often but with lots of time in between, like how to log on to remote computers, adding printers to your computer, etc. It will save you a lot of time in the long run. Similarly, save info about things you never remember how to do, such as the behavior of the FFT implementation in MATLAB, check if a file exists using bash, undo a Git merge, etc.</p>\n\n<p>I keep all my notes in individual text files. I have about 800. They live on Dropbox, which means I can edit them and view them anywhere. On my Mac I use <a href=\"http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/\">nvAlt</a> to search and write them. <a href=\"http://www.resoph.com/ResophNotes/Welcome.html\">ResophNotes</a> does the same thing on Windows. <a href=\"https://evernote.com\">Evernote</a> is a web-based service that can be used for a similar purpose. I write all my notes in <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/markdown\">Markdown</a> (I even wrote a paper in it!), which also allows me to easily export my notes or view in <a href=\"http://marked2app.com\">nice previews</a>. Both nvAlt and ResophNotes are &ldquo;markdown-aware&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"keep-a-logbook\">Keep a Logbook</h3>\n\n<p>I kept a daily or weekly text file in which I wrote almost everything I did within the day. I would write down either thing that I wanted to do, notes to clarify my thoughts, or the things I just did. For example, I would save the <a href=\"http://www.git-scm.com\">Git</a> commit for a particular simulation and my comments about the results. It helped me when I wanted to look back at why I did certain things or to find the source of certain ideas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sometimes-paper-is-the-best-tool-for-the-job\">Sometimes Paper Is the Best Tool for the Job</h3>\n\n<p>I tried doing everything on the computer, but sometime paper really is the best tool for the job. The final product doesn&rsquo;t have to be on paper but paper is often really helpful to develop ideas because of the freedom you have to place things <em>wherever</em> you want!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"if-it-s-broken-fix-it\">If It&rsquo;s Broken, Fix It</h3>\n\n<p>If you see something that is broken, or that could be better, just fix it. Especially if other people have noticed the same problem. I mean to fix both immaterial things (BitBucket, for example) but also physical things. Did you know you can report broken things to <a href=\"https://www.dtu.dk/english/about/organization/supportfunctions/cas\">CAS</a> and they&rsquo;ll come repair it within a day or so? Blocked toilet, dead light, water leek? Report it at <a href=\"http://fejlmeld.cas.dtu.dk\">https://fejlmeld.cas.dtu.dk</a> or use their <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/dk/app/dtu-fejlrapportering/id768685289?mt=8\">iOS</a> or Android apps (can&rsquo;t find the link, but look for DTU Fejlrapportering).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"writing\">Writing</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"build-an-outline-when-writing-a-paper\">Build an Outline When Writing a Paper</h3>\n\n<p>At first, I did not have a method for writing but then I read <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150406072222/http://timotheepoisot.fr/2014/09/25/writing-paper/\">this article</a> by Timothée Poisot, which really helped me. The main idea is to start building an outline as soon as you&rsquo;re working on the new project. As you read papers, or have ideas, you add quotes, citations, and snippets to your outline. You can start writing sentences and whole paragraphs whenever you want. The big advantage is that all the relevant things you find for a given project are all together; no need to go hunting for where you read that <em>thing</em>, six months ago.</p>\n\n<p>On the Mac, I use <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20161023123451/http://www.topoftree.jp/en/\">Tree</a><sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:tree\"><a href=\"#fn:tree\">2</a></sup>, which I <em>love</em>. <a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner/\">OmniOutliner</a> is the most famous alternative, but it much more expensive. I don&rsquo;t know about Windows or Linux. I know Microsoft Word has an outlining mode that could work. You could also outline in a normal Word document, or a text file, but good outliners give you many shortcuts to move things around and to insert new ideas. The new <a href=\"http://www.manuscriptsapp.com\">Manuscripts</a> application for Mac looks <em>amazing</em>. <a href=\"http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php\">Scrivener</a> is an amazing writing tool for both Mac and Windows. It is particularly good for large projects.</p>\n\n<p>Other good resources include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.organizingcreativity.com/2013/02/scientific-academic-paper-writing-template/\">Scientific / Academic Paper Writing Template | ORGANIZING CREATIVITY</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blogs.cul.columbia.edu/butler/2014/06/05/daniel-wessel-using-content-outlines-and-circus-ponies-notebooks-for-writing-articles-and-theses/\">Daniel Wessel: Using Content Outlines and Circus Ponies Notebooks for Writing Articles and Theses | Butler Library Blog</a> explains in even more details the idea of building an outline when writing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"get-good-early-and-write-more\">Get Good Early and Write More</h3>\n\n<p>Do not despair, you will get better at writing! I don&rsquo;t really know how to do it, but the earlier you get good the easier your life will be. :-) A possible way to get better is certainly to write more. Maybe having a <a href=\"http://academicwritingclub.com\">writing club</a> would help. There are many good books about writing. I read <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/pubs/books/4441010\"><em>How to write a lot</em></a>, by Paul J. Silvia and really liked it.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few articles about writing:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThSanger/status/664839630567686144\">10 writing tips and the psychology behind them.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2010/10/how-to-be-a-speed-writer\">How to Be a Speed Writer</a> supports the outlining idea.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mleone/web/how-to.html\">Advice on Research and Writing</a> is a collection of other articles on research, writing, speaking, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"reading\">Reading</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"make-time\">Make Time</h3>\n\n<p>You never find time, you&rsquo;ll have to make some. Personally I found out that I could read an article on the bus and while walking. When I needed to read many article, I would take the bus mornings and nights for a week. That way I could read about 10 articles in week. It helped me to keep a stack of papers that I wanted to read on my desk; I could grab one whenever had a moment.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"read-with-a-goal\">Read With a Goal</h3>\n\n<p>I find that it&rsquo;s much easier to understand and remember papers if I read with a purpose, as a way of answering a question. Also, if that question is related to what you&rsquo;re currently working on, you can add your discoveries in the outline of your paper.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"give-faces-to-names\">Give Faces to Names</h3>\n\n<p>I found that being able to associate a face with an author name helped me remember who was talking about what and made it easier to remember different papers and ideas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"take-notes-and-highlights\">Take Notes and Highlights</h3>\n\n<p>That one is pretty obvious, but writing down notes and ideas while reading papers really helps. It helps while reading the paper but also later when coming back to it. I designed a highlight system for myself based on the idea of <a href=\"http://jones.kaist.edu/notebook/2012/09/an-academic-notetaking-workflow.html\">Walton Jones</a>. I used specific colors to code different things, for example paper-specific results were yellow, new references in green, and paper summaries in red. This way could look back at a paper and have a general overview of what was important without reading the whole paper again.</p>\n\n<p>On the Mac, <a href=\"http://skim-app.sourceforge.net\">Skim</a> allows you to export notes including their color. It also works well with DEVONthink (see below).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"have-a-good-personal-search-engine\">Have a Good &ldquo;Personal Search Engine&rdquo;</h3>\n\n<p>I recommend having a good search system for your notes and papers. On the Mac I use an application called <a href=\"https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink\">DEVONthink</a> which can show you documents related to the one you&rsquo;re currently reading. It also does non-exact searches, e.g., it can search for the <em>meaning</em> of your query, not just the exact words you typed. It really is magic. I am not aware of anything exactly the same on Windows or Linux, but <a href=\"https://www.thebrain.com\">The Brain</a> (Windows) and <a href=\"https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/\">Recoll</a> might be good places to start.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"give-your-articles-unique-identifiers\">Give Your Articles Unique Identifiers</h3>\n\n<p>I gave all my articles the same file name structure, <code>authorYEARfirstword</code>, e.g. <code>chabotleclerc2014predicting</code>. I picked this format because it has no space and it&rsquo;s also very short and compact. It&rsquo;s essentially a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier\">unique identifier</a>. I used the identifier everywhere: in handwritten notes, computer notes, outlines, marginalia. This way, I knew exactly which paper I was talking about.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"remembering-things\">Remembering Things</h3>\n\n<p>I tried to use <a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition\">spaced repetition</a> (also see <a href=\"https://sivers.org/srs\">this link</a>) for a while but it didn&rsquo;t stick for really long. <a href=\"http://ankisrs.net\">Anki</a> is probably the best tool for the job.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"things-that-didn-t-work\">Things That Didn&rsquo;t Work</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"having-a-wiki\">Having a Wiki</h3>\n\n<p>Based on the idea of this crazy guy, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160703184126/http://www.reganmian.net/wiki/researchr:start\">Stian Håklev</a>, I tried setting up a wiki using either <a href=\"https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki#\">DokuWiki</a> or <a href=\"http://tiddlywiki.com\">TiddlyWiki</a>. I managed to keep it updated for about a month and then abandoned it. It required a lot of maintenance and a lot of diligence to keep up with the linking between subjects.</p>\n\n<p>2021 update: These days, I would strongly recommend looking into  <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/\">Zettelkasten</a> as an alternative.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"a-single-giant-outline-mind-map-or-concept-map\">A Single Giant Outline, Mind Map or Concept Map</h3>\n\n<p>I tried building a gigantic outline or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map\">mind map</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map\">concept map</a> of all the things I learned, but it became unmanageable. I still find these methods really useful when fleshing out an idea for a project or paper, but they were not really good tools for me to manage such a large amount of knowledge. If you want to try these tools, on the Mac I recommend <a href=\"http://mindnode.com\">MindNode</a> (simple and cheap), and <a href=\"http://toketaware.com/ithoughts-osx/\">iThoughtsX</a> (more powerful, more expensive). <a href=\"http://mindmeister.com\">MindMeister</a> is online and very popular. <a href=\"https://docear.org\">Docear</a> mixes an outliner, a reference manager (JabRef) and an outliner. It&rsquo;s power and complex. If you want to know everything about mind mapping and the best tools, check out <a href=\"http://brettterpstra.com/topic/mindmapping/\">Brett Terpstra&rsquo;s blog</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For concept maps, I <em>love</em> <a href=\"http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scapple.php\">Scapple</a>, which works on Mac and Windows. <a href=\"http://cmap.ihmc.us\">Cmap</a> is also multi-platform, but heavier. I use them when I want to find structure in a mess of ideas floating in my head.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"speaking\">Speaking</h2>\n\n<p>This series of articles by David L Stern really influenced me: <a href=\"http://www.howtogiveatalk.com\"><em>How to Give a Talk</em></a>. He suggests 5 rules<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:talk\"><a href=\"#fn:talk\">3</a></sup>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t put words on slides</li>\n<li>Use black slides</li>\n<li>Show your data</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t tell jokes</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t take a data dump on your audience</li>\n<li>Practice, practice, practice.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Of course, some rules are meant to be broken, but it&rsquo;s worth a read. I also liked the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Presentation-Zen-Simple-Delivery-Edition/dp/0321811984\"><em>Presentation Zen: Simple Ideas on Presentation Design and Delivery</em></a> by Garr Reynolds.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"programming\">Programming</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"when-modeling-optimize-for-a-metric\">When Modeling, Optimize for a Metric</h3>\n\n<p>When working on a new model, first decide what you&rsquo;re optimizing for, is it a correlation, the mean square error, or some other metric. Make sure this metric is computed automatically with each simulation, so you have immediate feedback about how good your model is. Just eyeballing the results is a really bad idea.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"d-r-y\">D.R.Y.</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself\">Don&rsquo;t. Repeat. Yourself.</a> When you see that you have the same code in multiple places, it&rsquo;s a good hint that you need to refactor it into a function, and to call that function. Also, if your function is hundred lines long it&rsquo;s probably a sign that he should be chopped into smaller functions that have clear names.</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in becoming a better programmer, I recommend <a href=\"https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/\"><em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em></a>, by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code\"><em>Clean Code</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4845.Code_Complete\"><em>Code Complete</em></a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"write-tests\">Write Tests</h3>\n\n<p>You should write tests for your functions to make sure that they are actually doing what you think they are doing. They help make sure that code is correct, they help detecting regressions (when you break things that used to work), they act as a specification, design and documentation, and they make refactoring easier.</p>\n\n<p>I cannot tell you how many times I found small and huge bugs because of the tests I wrote. All decent programming languages, <a href=\"https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-unit-test-framework.html\">including Matlab</a> include a framework to automatically run tests. The words you want to look for are &ldquo;unit testing&rdquo;. You should run tests every time you make changes. You can even set Git to <a href=\"http://codeinthehole.com/writing/tips-for-using-a-git-pre-commit-hook/\">run the tests before every commit</a>. This way you can make sure you never commit broken code.</p>\n\n<p>The advantage of working with a free language (Python!) and in the open is that you can use &ldquo;continuous integration&rdquo; system to have them run tests every time you push new changes to GitHub (or BitBucket). <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/\">Travis CI</a> is one of those services.</p>\n\n<p>These articles or sites are worth reading for info about testing.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.tdda.info\">Test-Driven Data Analysis</a>. Start <a href=\"http://www.tdda.info/test-driven-development-a-review.html\">here</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=5825\">Is your research software correct</a>, by Mike Croucher, a Research Software Engineer at The University of Sheffield.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"don-t-overuse-code-comments\">Don&rsquo;t Overuse Code Comments</h3>\n\n<p>Code comments are useful to explain <em>why</em> you&rsquo;re doing something, but they should not explain every single line of code. Otherwise one day you will change the comment or the code and then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nzkoz/status/538892801941848064\">one of them will be lying</a> and you won&rsquo;t be able to know <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CPiszshU8AAyK4Q.jpg\">which one</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, use explicit names for variables and functions. Write function help files. Write documentation. Write README files. And break up long and complicated lines of code into smaller ones where you can name concepts and variables.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"use-version-control\">Use Version Control</h3>\n\n<p>Version control is a communication tool and a collaboration tool. It&rsquo;s invaluable even if you don&rsquo;t work with someone else, I can assure you that your future self will be really happy to know what your past self was thinking when he/she wrote that code/text. I heard your future self can get really upset. :-)</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"track-where-stuff-comes-from\">Track Where Stuff Comes From</h3>\n\n<p>Track where experiment results and figures come from. You can do it by hand, by keeping your log book and tracking output folders and inputs commits, but you can also use automated solutions. I used <a href=\"http://neuralensemble.org/sumatra/\">Sumatra</a>, which is written in Python but can be used with Matlab. Every time you run a simulation it saves to a database: the experimental parameter used, the input files, and the command line outputs. It also allows you to comment and tag results. You can look back and see where things are from, what worked and what didn&rsquo;t, and rerun experiments with exactly the same parameters. A provenance-tracking tool like Sumatra paired with version control is a good step towards making reproducible research. <a href=\"https://github.com/recipy/recipy/\">Recipy</a> is a new Python-only solution that looks interesting.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"follow-best-practices\">Follow &ldquo;Best practices&rdquo;</h3>\n\n<p>Some very bright people have written &ldquo;Best practices&rdquo; for scientific computing. It&rsquo;s worth reading the two or three articles below and applying their recommendations. I also recommend looking at this <a href=\"https://github.com/uwescience/shablona\"><code>shablona</code></a> project, which proposes a standard folder structure for a given project, I found it to work really well. It&rsquo;s written with Python in mind but it could easily be adapted for Matlab.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745\"><em>Best Practices for Scientific Computing</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://swcarpentry.github.io/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/\"><em>Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing</em></a> is a follow-up article.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Learn about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming\">literate programming</a>, a useful concept where the code and the text (of, e.g., an article) live <em>together</em>. This can be done in Matlab using the <a href=\"http://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/publish.html\"><code>publish</code></a> command. In Python, the <a href=\"http://jupyter.org\">Jupyter notebook</a> is <em>the</em> way to go. Actually, you can use the Jupyter notebook <a href=\"https://github.com/calysto/matlab_kernel\"><em>with</em> Matlab</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to do more than just read things, you should try to organizing a <a href=\"http://software-carpentry.org\">Software Carpentry</a> workshop. It&rsquo;s pretty much free and would probably help <em>a lot of people</em>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"your-computer-should-work-for-you\">Your Computer Should Work for You</h3>\n\n<p>If you find out you&rsquo;re doing the same thing over and over again <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1205/\">it might be worth automating it</a>. On the Mac, <a href=\"http://keyboardmaestro.com\">Keyboard Maestro</a> can do magic (like activating menu items for you, clicking places, moving windows, etc.) On Windows, <a href=\"https://www.autohotkey.com\">AutoHotkey</a> can do similar things, and on Linux, I found <a href=\"https://github.com/autokey/autokey\">AutoKey</a> to be the best.</p>\n\n<p>Use a shortcut expander application. For example, I never type &ldquo;intelligibility&rdquo;, I just type <code>inty</code> and it expands to the full word.

				"content_text": "> I shared these notes with my friends and colleagues at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) when I finished my PhD in December 2015.\n\nHere are things that I either learned during my PhD, or that helped me get through it. I in no way have all the answers, but there are a few things that helped me that I think would be helpful to other people as well.\n\nI split the content in six different sections, meta-things, writing, reading, speaking, programming, and mind and body. I included links to articles, books, and tools that are related to each section.\n\n## Meta\n\nThe main recommendation here is to have a system to deal with all the things you have to do and the things you want to do. I personally used the GTD method, which stands for [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com). I highly recommend getting the latest book. You can find it [delivered at your desk for 100 kr](http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=0143126563&destination=dk&currency=DKK&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr). The main ideas of the system are: everything goes in an inbox (physical and/or on a computer). Periodically, process the inbox and decide if you'll do the thing, trash it, or store it in your reference system. \"Tasks\" that require more than two action are considered projects, and a project consist of a list of *physical*, *actionable* actions. The other important thing about GTD is that it includes a weekly review of all the projects in your system, as well as your calendar and other active things in your life. I learned about this almost 10 years ago now[^gtd] and I would go as far as to say that it changed my life. \n\n[^gtd]: Make it 13 years in 2021.\n\nThere are many applications designed to implement the GTD system. On the Mac, there's [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/), [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/), and [TaskPaper](http://www.taskpaper.com) (*really worth checking*). [Todoist](https://todoist.com) is multi-platform.\n\nI also recommend reading [*Getting Results the Agile Way*, by J.D. Meier](https://gettingresults.com), which proposes a different take on selecting *what* you should work in. The basic idea is to pick 3 things to focus on every day, three per week, three per month, and three per year. The things you do every day should go towards you weekly goals, etc. The [Asian Efficiency](https://gettingresults.com) blog (weird name, I know), is a good noise-free resource about that kind of material (check the \"specialty topics\" in the sidebar).\n\n### Make checklists\n\nKeep checklists for processes and things you do often but with lots of time in between, like how to log on to remote computers, adding printers to your computer, etc. It will save you a lot of time in the long run. Similarly, save info about things you never remember how to do, such as the behavior of the FFT implementation in MATLAB, check if a file exists using bash, undo a Git merge, etc.\n\nI keep all my notes in individual text files. I have about 800. They live on Dropbox, which means I can edit them and view them anywhere. On my Mac I use [nvAlt](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) to search and write them. [ResophNotes](http://www.resoph.com/ResophNotes/Welcome.html) does the same thing on Windows. [Evernote](https://evernote.com) is a web-based service that can be used for a similar purpose. I write all my notes in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/markdown) (I even wrote a paper in it!), which also allows me to easily export my notes or view in [nice previews](http://marked2app.com). Both nvAlt and ResophNotes are \"markdown-aware\".\n\n\n### Keep a Logbook\n\nI kept a daily or weekly text file in which I wrote almost everything I did within the day. I would write down either thing that I wanted to do, notes to clarify my thoughts, or the things I just did. For example, I would save the [Git](http://www.git-scm.com) commit for a particular simulation and my comments about the results. It helped me when I wanted to look back at why I did certain things or to find the source of certain ideas.\n\n### Sometimes Paper Is the Best Tool for the Job\n\nI tried doing everything on the computer, but sometime paper really is the best tool for the job. The final product doesn't have to be on paper but paper is often really helpful to develop ideas because of the freedom you have to place things *wherever* you want!\n\n\n### If It's Broken, Fix It\n\nIf you see something that is broken, or that could be better, just fix it. Especially if other people have noticed the same problem. I mean to fix both immaterial things (BitBucket, for example) but also physical things. Did you know you can report broken things to [CAS](https://www.dtu.dk/english/about/organization/supportfunctions/cas) and they'll come repair it within a day or so? Blocked toilet, dead light, water leek? Report it at [https://fejlmeld.cas.dtu.dk](http://fejlmeld.cas.dtu.dk) or use their [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/dk/app/dtu-fejlrapportering/id768685289?mt=8) or Android apps (can't find the link, but look for DTU Fejlrapportering).\n\n## Writing\n\n### Build an Outline When Writing a Paper\n\nAt first, I did not have a method for writing but then I read [this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20150406072222/http://timotheepoisot.fr/2014/09/25/writing-paper/) by Timothée Poisot, which really helped me. The main idea is to start building an outline as soon as you're working on the new project. As you read papers, or have ideas, you add quotes, citations, and snippets to your outline. You can start writing sentences and whole paragraphs whenever you want. The big advantage is that all the relevant things you find for a given project are all together; no need to go hunting for where you read that *thing*, six months ago. \n\nOn the Mac, I use [Tree](https://web.archive.org/web/20161023123451/http://www.topoftree.jp/en/)[^tree], which I *love*. [OmniOutliner](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner/) is the most famous alternative, but it much more expensive. I don't know about Windows or Linux. I know Microsoft Word has an outlining mode that could work. You could also outline in a normal Word document, or a text file, but good outliners give you many shortcuts to move things around and to insert new ideas. The new [Manuscripts](http://www.manuscriptsapp.com) application for Mac looks *amazing*. [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) is an amazing writing tool for both Mac and Windows. It is particularly good for large projects.\n\nOther good resources include:\n\n- [Scientific / Academic Paper Writing Template | ORGANIZING CREATIVITY](http://www.organizingcreativity.com/2013/02/scientific-academic-paper-writing-template/)\n- [Daniel Wessel: Using Content Outlines and Circus Ponies Notebooks for Writing Articles and Theses | Butler Library Blog](https://blogs.cul.columbia.edu/butler/2014/06/05/daniel-wessel-using-content-outlines-and-circus-ponies-notebooks-for-writing-articles-and-theses/) explains in even more details the idea of building an outline when writing.\n\n[^tree]: Not available anymore, 2021-01-23.\n\n\n### Get Good Early and Write More\n\nDo not despair, you will get better at writing! I don't really know how to do it, but the earlier you get good the easier your life will be. :-) A possible way to get better is certainly to write more. Maybe having a [writing club](http://academicwritingclub.com) would help. There are many good books about writing. I read [*How to write a lot*](https://www.apa.org/pubs/books/4441010), by Paul J. Silvia and really liked it.\n\nHere are a few articles about writing:\n\n- [10 writing tips and the psychology behind them.](https://twitter.com/ThSanger/status/664839630567686144)\n- [How to Be a Speed Writer](https://hbr.org/2010/10/how-to-be-a-speed-writer) supports the outlining idea.\n- [Advice on Research and Writing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mleone/web/how-to.html) is a collection of other articles on research, writing, speaking, etc.\n\n\n## Reading\n\n### Make Time\n\nYou never find time, you'll have to make some. Personally I found out that I could read an article on the bus and while walking. When I needed to read many article, I would take the bus mornings and nights for a week. That way I could read about 10 articles in week. It helped me to keep a stack of papers that I wanted to read on my desk; I could grab one whenever had a moment.\n\n### Read With a Goal\n\nI find that it's much easier to understand and remember papers if I read with a purpose, as a way of answering a question. Also, if that question is related to what you're currently working on, you can add your discoveries in the outline of your paper.\n\n### Give Faces to Names\n\nI found that being able to associate a face with an author name helped me remember who was talking about what and made it easier to remember different papers and ideas.\n\n### Take Notes and Highlights\n\nThat one is pretty obvious, but writing down notes and ideas while reading papers really helps. It helps while reading the paper but also later when coming back to it. I designed a highlight system for myself based on the idea of [Walton Jones](http://jones.kaist.edu/notebook/2012/09/an-academic-notetaking-workflow.html). I used specific colors to code different things, for example paper-specific results were yellow, new references in green, and paper summaries in red. This way could look back at a paper and have a general overview of what was important without reading the whole paper again. \n\nOn the Mac, [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net) allows you to export notes including their color. It also works well with DEVONthink (see below).\n\n### Have a Good \"Personal Search Engine\"\n\nI recommend having a good search system for your notes and papers. On the Mac I use an application called [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) which can show you documents related to the one you're currently reading. It also does non-exact searches, e.g., it can search for the *meaning* of your query, not just the exact words you typed. It really is magic. I am not aware of anything exactly the same on Windows or Linux, but [The Brain](https://www.thebrain.com) (Windows) and [Recoll](https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/) might be good places to start.\n\n### Give Your Articles Unique Identifiers\n\nI gave all my articles the same file name structure, `authorYEARfirstword`, e.g. `chabotleclerc2014predicting`. I picked this format because it has no space and it's also very short and compact. It's essentially a [unique identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier). I used the identifier everywhere: in handwritten notes, computer notes, outlines, marginalia. This way, I knew exactly which paper I was talking about.\n\n### Remembering Things\n\nI tried to use [spaced repetition](http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition) (also see [this link](https://sivers.org/srs)) for a while but it didn't stick for really long. [Anki](http://ankisrs.net) is probably the best tool for the job.\n\n## Things That Didn't Work\n\n### Having a Wiki\n\nBased on the idea of this crazy guy, [Stian Håklev](https://web.archive.org/web/20160703184126/http://www.reganmian.net/wiki/researchr:start), I tried setting up a wiki using either [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki#) or [TiddlyWiki](http://tiddlywiki.com). I managed to keep it updated for about a month and then abandoned it. It required a lot of maintenance and a lot of diligence to keep up with the linking between subjects. \n\n2021 update: These days, I would strongly recommend looking into  [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) as an alternative.\n\n### A Single Giant Outline, Mind Map or Concept Map\n\nI tried building a gigantic outline or [mind map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) or [concept map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map) of all the things I learned, but it became unmanageable. I still find these methods really useful when fleshing out an idea for a project or paper, but they were not really good tools for me to manage such a large amount of knowledge. If you want to try these tools, on the Mac I recommend [MindNode](http://mindnode.com) (simple and cheap), and [iThoughtsX](http://toketaware.com/ithoughts-osx/) (more powerful, more expensive). [MindMeister](http://mindmeister.com) is online and very popular. [Docear](https://docear.org) mixes an outliner, a reference manager (JabRef) and an outliner. It's power and complex. If you want to know everything about mind mapping and the best tools, check out [Brett Terpstra's blog](http://brettterpstra.com/topic/mindmapping/).\n\nFor concept maps, I *love* [Scapple](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scapple.php), which works on Mac and Windows. [Cmap](http://cmap.ihmc.us) is also multi-platform, but heavier. I use them when I want to find structure in a mess of ideas floating in my head.\n\n \n## Speaking\n \nThis series of articles by David L Stern really influenced me: [*How to Give a Talk*](http://www.howtogiveatalk.com). He suggests 5 rules[^talk]: \n\n1. Don't put words on slides\n2. Use black slides\n3. Show your data\n4. Don't tell jokes\n5. Don't take a data dump on your audience\n6. Practice, practice, practice.\n\nOf course, some rules are meant to be broken, but it's worth a read. I also liked the book [_Presentation Zen: Simple Ideas on Presentation Design and Delivery_](http://www.amazon.com/Presentation-Zen-Simple-Delivery-Edition/dp/0321811984) by Garr Reynolds.\n\n[^talk]: Yes, that 6 rules. And it 2021, it grew to 8 rules. ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\n \n## Programming\n\n### When Modeling, Optimize for a Metric\n\nWhen working on a new model, first decide what you're optimizing for, is it a correlation, the mean square error, or some other metric. Make sure this metric is computed automatically with each simulation, so you have immediate feedback about how good your model is. Just eyeballing the results is a really bad idea.\n\n### D.R.Y.\n\n[Don't. Repeat. Yourself.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) When you see that you have the same code in multiple places, it's a good hint that you need to refactor it into a function, and to call that function. Also, if your function is hundred lines long it's probably a sign that he should be chopped into smaller functions that have clear names.\n\nIf you're interested in becoming a better programmer, I recommend [_The Pragmatic Programmer_](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/), by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas, [_Clean Code_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code) and [_Code Complete_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4845.Code_Complete).\n\n### Write Tests\n\nYou should write tests for your functions to make sure that they are actually doing what you think they are doing. They help make sure that code is correct, they help detecting regressions (when you break things that used to work), they act as a specification, design and documentation, and they make refactoring easier.\n\nI cannot tell you how many times I found small and huge bugs because of the tests I wrote. All decent programming languages, [including Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-unit-test-framework.html) include a framework to automatically run tests. The words you want to look for are \"unit testing\". You should run tests every time you make changes. You can even set Git to [run the tests before every commit](http://codeinthehole.com/writing/tips-for-using-a-git-pre-commit-hook/). This way you can make sure you never commit broken code. \n\nThe advantage of working with a free language (Python!) and in the open is that you can use \"continuous integration\" system to have them run tests every time you push new changes to GitHub (or BitBucket). [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is one of those services. \n\nThese articles or sites are worth reading for info about testing.\n\n- [Test-Driven Data Analysis](http://www.tdda.info). Start [here](http://www.tdda.info/test-driven-development-a-review.html).\n- [Is your research software correct](http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=5825), by Mike Croucher, a Research Software Engineer at The University of Sheffield.\n\n### Don't Overuse Code Comments\n\nCode comments are useful to explain *why* you're doing something, but they should not explain every single line of code. Otherwise one day you will change the comment or the code and then [one of them will be lying](https://twitter.com/nzkoz/status/538892801941848064) and you won't be able to know [which one](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CPiszshU8AAyK4Q.jpg).\n\nInstead, use explicit names for variables and functions. Write function help files. Write documentation. Write README files. And break up long and complicated lines of code into smaller ones where you can name concepts and variables.\n\n### Use Version Control\n\nVersion control is a communication tool and a collaboration tool. It's invaluable even if you don't work with someone else, I can assure you that your future self will be really happy to know what your past self was thinking when he/she wrote that code/text. I heard your future self can get really upset. :-)\n\n### Track Where Stuff Comes From\n\nTrack where experiment results and figures come from. You can do it by hand, by keeping your log book and tracking output folders and inputs commits, but you can also use automated solutions. I used [Sumatra](http://neuralensemble.org/sumatra/), which is written in Python but can be used with Matlab. Every time you run a simulation it saves to a database: the experimental parameter used, the input files, and the command line outputs. It also allows you to comment and tag results. You can look back and see where things are from, what worked and what didn't, and rerun experiments with exactly the same parameters. A provenance-tracking tool like Sumatra paired with version control is a good step towards making reproducible research. [Recipy](https://github.com/recipy/recipy/) is a new Python-only solution that looks interesting.\n\n### Follow \"Best practices\"\n\nSome very bright people have written \"Best practices\" for scientific computing. It's worth reading the two or three articles below and applying their recommendations. I also recommend looking at this [`shablona`](https://github.com/uwescience/shablona) project, which proposes a standard folder structure for a given project, I found it to work really well. It's written with Python in mind but it could easily be adapted for Matlab.\n\n- [_Best Practices for Scientific Computing_](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745)\n- [_Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing_](http://swcarpentry.github.io/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/) is a follow-up article.\n\nLearn about [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), a useful concept where the code and the text (of, e.g., an article) live *together*. This can be done in Matlab using the [`publish`](http://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/publish.html) command. In Python, the [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org) is *the* way to go. Actually, you can use the Jupyter notebook [*with* Matlab](https://github.com/calysto/matlab_kernel).\n\nIf you want to do more than just read things, you should try to organizing a [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) workshop. It's pretty much free and would probably help *a lot of people*.\n\n### Your Computer Should Work for You\n\nIf you find out you're doing the same thing over and over again [it might be worth automating it](https://xkcd.com/1205/). On the Mac, [Keyboard Maestro](http://keyboardmaestro.com) can do magic (like activating menu items for you, clicking places, moving windows, etc.) On Windows, [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) can do similar things, and on Linux, I found [AutoKey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey) to be the best. \n\nUse a shortcut expander application. For example, I never type \"intelligibility\", I just type `inty` and it expands to the full word. Same thing with my name, my bank account, my phone number, etc. On the Mac, Keyboard Maestro and [TextExpander](https://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html) are the best. On Windows, [PhraseExpress](http://www.phraseexpress.com) is compatible with TextExpander; you can sync your snippets via Dropbox. On Linux, Autokey can also do snippet expansions.\n\n\n## Mind and body\n\n### Take Care of Your Body\n\nSeriously, take care of your body. If you start having wrist, forearm, or shoulder pain, don't just live with it. Seek help and get proper a keyboard, mouse and chair. Learn some basic ergonomic practices about keyboard, mouse and screen placement. See the articles below for more info and recommendations. \n\nIf you are in pain, really look for help: find a massage therapist, a doctor, and stretch often. Here are a few good ressources.\n\n- [10 Tips for Using a Computer Mouse](http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/cumousetips.html)\n- A long list of ergonomic keyboards, by [xahlee](http://xahlee.info/kbd/ergonomic_keyboards.htm).\n- The [Microsoft Sculpt](http://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop/l5v-00001) is probably the most affordable ergonomic keyboard. \n- [Kinesis](http://www.kinesis-ergo.com) makes amazing products. I have an Advantage keyboard and an Evoluent Vertical Mouse. The Advantage is amazing.\n- If you have any wrist pains, I (Alex) highly recommend the book [_It's Not Carpal Tunnel Syndrome!: RSI Theory and Therapy for Computer Professional_](http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=0965510999&new_used=*&destination=dk&currency=DKK&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr) by Suparna Damany and Jack Belli. The exercises in it really helped me.\n\n### Spend Money Where Your Time Is\n\nIt's worth paying for things that make your life better, more comfortable, and easier, especially if you use those things all day long. Buy a nice keyboard, you probably write eight or nine hours a day. Buy nice headphones, good software, a mattress, a bike, etc.\n\n### Ask for Help\n\nAsk for help when you're stuck. Ask for a meeting if you need one. Everyone is super busy, but everyone is super generous. People rarely say no, but they might say \"later\". In a perfect world, everyone would be proactive, everyone would have their slot in the calendar, but sometimes the world is not perfect. Also talking to people if often *waaaay* faster than googling for an answer.\n\n## Make *Every Day* a Non-Zero Day\n\nThis idea is not from me, it is [from ryans01 on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af) (and it's also in the PhD Starter Kit, below). His idea is to make sure that every day you do at least one small thing towards your goal. No day should be completely wasted, even if the thing you do is really small. Keeping a log or journal helps realizing all the things you've done in a day and keeping your mood up.\n\n## Other Guides Like This One\n\nOther people have written really good and more in-depth guides than this. The [_PhD Starter Kit_](https://raoofphysics.github.io/phd-starter-kit/) is simply amazing. Philip Guo's [_Advice for first year PhD students_](http://www.pgbovine.net/advice-for-first-year-PhD-students.htm) is a must-read/must-watch (as well as *many* of his other articles. He also wrote: [_The Ph.D. Grind_](http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/niuli/resource/pguo-PhD-grind.pdf), a 115-page e-book, is the first known detailed account of an entire Ph.D. experience.\" That guy is amazing.\n",

				"title": "2020 Holiday Newsletter",
				"content_html": "\n\n<p>For the past 4 years, just before the holidays, I&rsquo;ve sent a newsletter to my colleagues about all the things I&rsquo;ve read, watched, listened to, cooked, or ate in the last year. This is the 2020 edition.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-christopher-alexander-idea-patch\">The Christopher Alexander <em>idea patch</em></h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://saguenaylacsaintjean.ca/en/\">Where I’m from</a>, there are so many blueberries that people from that region are called <em>bleuets</em>. (The tourist info phone number is 1-877-BLEUETS (253-8387). You should go and visit.) When you go out to pick them (the blueberries, not the people) and you hit a patch with tons of them, we say &ldquo;I found <em>une talle</em>!&rdquo; That’s how it felt getting into Christopher Alexander&rsquo;s ideas.</p>\n\n<p>You might know of Alexander without realizing it. He&rsquo;s considered as the father of the idea of <em>design patterns</em>, which were heavily inspired by his book architecture book <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language\"><em>A Pattern Language</em></a>. Patterns are part of a larger process to solve design problems, from problem definitions, to solutions, to the evaluation of how good the solution is. It&rsquo;s that larger process that I found interesting. He named the parts of the process <em>context</em>, <em>form</em>, and <em>fit</em>. In brief, the <em>context</em> is the problem to be solved together with its constraints. It&rsquo;s totally independent of the solution. The <em>form</em> is the solution. It has a shape that <em>fits</em> the context more of less well. Once I had these words in my mind, I started seeing them everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Clay Christiensen&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.christenseninstitute.org/key-concepts/jobs-to-be-done/\"><em>Jobs-to-be-Done</em></a> framework (from <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28820024-competing-against-luck\"><em>Competing Against Luck</em></a>) is a way of defining product opportunities (<em>jobs</em>) as a context that can be fulfilled in many different ways. To get an idea of what that means, watch him telling the story of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Stc0beAxavY\">job of a milkshake</a> and how milkshakes compete with bananas, donuts, and bagels, and not with ice cream.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55345571-demand-side-sales-101\"><em>Demand-Side Sales</em></a>, Bob Moesta (who did the milkshake research) talks about selling from the buyer&rsquo;s perspective, from their struggles, from their <em>context</em>. In contrast to selling from the supply-side, which talks about features and <em>form</em> words. I highly recommend this book.</p>\n\n<p>On the programming side, unit testing has morphed into <em>form testing</em>, whereas the original intent was <em>context testing</em>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development\">Behavior-driven development</a> tried to get that spirit back. What I heard Ian Cooper say in his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM\"><em>TDD, Where Did It All Go Wrong</em></a> talk was &ldquo;Write context tests.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Basecamp&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/shapeup\"><em>Shape Up</em></a> is basically Alexander&rsquo;s ideas applied to product development and management. It makes a clear distinction between shaping (defining the problem and the context) and doing the work (creating a form). Which in turns allows a new dimension of diagnosis when a project fails: was the project badly shaped or is it that the execution failed and form was a bad fit?</p>\n\n<p>Ryan Singer, head of strategy at Basecamp, did a great <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLsTZXT0FlM\">intro to Alexander&rsquo;s work</a> this summer.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-best-writing\">The Best Writing</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.leesandlin.com/articles/LosingTheWar.htm\"><em>Losing the War</em></a> by Lee Sandlin is the best writing I read this year (and I read it on January 1, 2020).\nIt&rsquo;s an incredible essay on war (the Second World One), and memories. I found the &ldquo;flow&rdquo; to be exemplary with plenty of historical context and commentary. Well worth the time.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"programming-cooking\"><code>programming == cooking</code></h3>\n\n<p>I used to tell students that I was &ldquo;teaching them how to fish.&rdquo; But after reading Robin Sloan’s <a href=\"https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/\"><em>Home Cooked App</em></a>, I’ve started telling people I&rsquo;m teaching them how to cook. It’s a <em>much richer</em> analogy.</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t know how to cook, you eat pre-packaged meals or you eat out (or you live with your mom forever). But there are tons of reasons to want to learn how to cook and tons of things to do once you&rsquo;ve learned how. You can cook for health reasons, to please friends, to create the perfect version of something, as a creative output, because you&rsquo;re picky, to make food you want to eat, because it&rsquo;s fun. You can specialize and become a baker, or open a taco truck, or start a family restaurant, or run a fine-dining restaurant. You can teach others how to cook. In the end, you can still go out and eat if you want, <em>you have a choice</em>. There are so many reasons to learn to cook.</p>\n\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t know how to program (or how to reason about programming) you use  apps you bought and hire consultants. But there are tons of reasons to want to learn how to program and tons of things to do once you&rsquo;ve learned how. You can create little scripts to rename files, write notebooks to make custom analyzes, write an app to enable friends and colleagues to explore data like you can, write your own text editor (!) because vim is holding you back, because it&rsquo;s fun. You can specialize and build deep learning models, or design data management systems, or build custom web apps, or start a scientific software development consultancy. You can teach others how to program. In the end, you can still hire consultants if you want, <em>you have a choice</em>. There are so many reasons to learn to program.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"techtalk\">#techtalk</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gtoolkit.com\">Glamorous Toolkit</a> is an impressive &ldquo;moldable development environment&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d describe it as a strange hybrid between a notebook editor and an IDE. Any objects can have a rich and interactive representations, which is not new (to us), but the cool part is that it&rsquo;s easy to dynamically add new rich representations to the development environment. Watch this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=Pot9GnHFOVU\">talk by Tudor Gîrba</a> to get a taste of what&rsquo;s possible.</p>\n\n<p>Simon Willison&rsquo;s (co-creator of Django) <a href=\"https://datasette.io\">Datasette</a> is an impressive project to &ldquo;explore and publish data&rdquo;. It relies heavily on sqlite. I look forward to playing with it some more over the holidays. He&rsquo;s done super cool things with it, including finding the <a href=\"http://simonwillison.net/2020/May/21/dogsheep-photos/\">best photo of a pelican according to Apple Photos</a>, and <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2020/Nov/28/datasette-ripgrep/\">building a regex search engine across a collection of Github repos using <code>ripgrep</code></a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"book-club\">#book-club</h3>\n\n<p>I started many books this year, but didn&rsquo;t finish that many:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems\"><em>Thinking in Systems</em></a> by Donella Meadows is a short introduction to &ldquo;systems thinking,&rdquo; their components (stocks, flows, feedback loops), common system configurations,  common pitfalls/opportunities of those configurations, and leverage points to intervene in those systems. I had so many &ldquo;Ah ha!&rdquo; moments. Many about things I &ldquo;knew&rdquo; but hadn&rsquo;t realized the consequences of. Like how &ldquo;systems with similar feedback structures produce similar dynamic behaviors, even if the outward appearance of these systems is completely dissimilar.&rdquo; For example, a population system (controlled by births and deaths) has a similar configuration as an economic capital system (controlled by investment and depreciation). Reading this book, it was so easy to think &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a silver bullet!&rdquo; but then she totally called me out on it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>People who are raised in the industrial world and who get enthused about systems thinking are likely to make a terrible mistake. They are likely to assume that here, in systems analysis, in interconnection and complication, in the power of the computer, here at last, is the key to prediction and control. This mistake is likely because the mind-set of the industrial world assumes that there is a key to prediction and control.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44735.The_Elements_of_Typographic_Style\"><em>Elements of Typographic Style</em></a> by Robert Bringhurst. Yes it&rsquo;s a typography book, but it may also be the funniest thing I read all year. Bonus: the book itself is a beautiful object.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733983-lab-girl\"><em>Lab Girl</em></a> by Hope Jahren is a wonderful memoir of a &ldquo;life in science.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s a good storyteller, telling  a good story, about how the path to success in academia can be wild.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But I read a <em>lot</em> of good articles:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In <a href=\"https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/orthographic/\"><em>Orthographic media</em></a>, Robin Sloan (him again) argues that social media is a little like an orthographic project (no perspective), you can&rsquo;t tell the relative importance of things. At least, not in the way that say, newspaper headlines conveyed that idea.</li>\n<li>Sacha Judd makes the point that there <em>may</em> be <a href=\"https://www.sachajudd.com/one-direction\">a diverse pipeline in tech</a> and that people are not where &ldquo;we&rdquo; are looking for them.</li>\n<li>The &ldquo;low tech&rdquo; internet described in this article by <a href=\"https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/how-to-build-a-low-tech-internet.html\">Low Tech Magazine</a> has caching and no assumption of synchronicity. It would make for a better &ldquo;high tech&rdquo; internet.</li>\n<li>Paul Graham, <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/lesson.html\">The Lesson to Unlearn</a>.</li>\n<li>Douglas Hofstadter writes about <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/01/the-shallowness-of-google-translate/551570/\"><em>The Shallowness of Google Translate</em></a>. Did you know that Hofstadter is a translator?!</li>\n<li>Dan Shapiro (CEO of Glowforge) writes <a href=\"https://www.danshapiro.com/blog/2019/02/fellow-white-dudes-lets-roll-a-d20/\"><em>Fellow White Dudes: Let’s Roll a d20</em></a>.</li>\n<li>In <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2000/05/balancing-act-how-to-capture-knowledge-without-killing-it\"><em>Balancing Act: How to Capture Knowledge Without Killing It</em></a> (HBR) John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid tell the story of Xerox&rsquo;s <em>Eureka</em> database and of the <em>community of practice</em> around it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"tyil-this-year-i-learned\">TYIL (This Year I Learned)</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouarzazate_Solar_Power_Station\">Ouarzazate Solar Power Station</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_energy_storage#Molten_salt_technology\">melts salt</a> by concentrating the power of 7400 parabolic mirrors towards a central tower.

Here&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch1aVmjvYTI\"><em>Somebody That I Used To Know (Bardcore/Medieval Style Cover with Vocals</em>)</a>. Bardcore is medieval renditions of pop songs. Obviously. So&hellip; the name Hildegard von Blingin’, is a reference to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hildegard_of_Bingen\">Hildegard von Bingen</a>, an 11th century badass abbess, composer, and scientist (among others). In the early 2000, my mom gave me a CD by Garmarna, a Swedish band that does&hellip; electro-folk renditions of her 11th-century music.  <code>Hildegard von Blingin' = 1/Garmarna</code>!

				"content_text": "For the past 4 years, just before the holidays, I've sent a newsletter to my colleagues about all the things I've read, watched, listened to, cooked, or ate in the last year. This is the 2020 edition.\n\n### The Christopher Alexander *idea patch*\n\n[Where I’m from](https://saguenaylacsaintjean.ca/en/), there are so many blueberries that people from that region are called _bleuets_. (The tourist info phone number is 1-877-BLEUETS (253-8387). You should go and visit.) When you go out to pick them (the blueberries, not the people) and you hit a patch with tons of them, we say \"I found _une talle_!\" That’s how it felt getting into Christopher Alexander's ideas.\n\nYou might know of Alexander without realizing it. He's considered as the father of the idea of *design patterns*, which were heavily inspired by his book architecture book [*A Pattern Language*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language). Patterns are part of a larger process to solve design problems, from problem definitions, to solutions, to the evaluation of how good the solution is. It's that larger process that I found interesting. He named the parts of the process *context*, *form*, and *fit*. In brief, the *context* is the problem to be solved together with its constraints. It's totally independent of the solution. The *form* is the solution. It has a shape that *fits* the context more of less well. Once I had these words in my mind, I started seeing them everywhere.\n\nClay Christiensen's [*Jobs-to-be-Done*](https://www.christenseninstitute.org/key-concepts/jobs-to-be-done/) framework (from [*Competing Against Luck*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28820024-competing-against-luck)) is a way of defining product opportunities (*jobs*) as a context that can be fulfilled in many different ways. To get an idea of what that means, watch him telling the story of the [job of a milkshake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Stc0beAxavY) and how milkshakes compete with bananas, donuts, and bagels, and not with ice cream.\n\nIn [*Demand-Side Sales*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55345571-demand-side-sales-101), Bob Moesta (who did the milkshake research) talks about selling from the buyer's perspective, from their struggles, from their *context*. In contrast to selling from the supply-side, which talks about features and *form* words. I highly recommend this book.\n\nOn the programming side, unit testing has morphed into *form testing*, whereas the original intent was *context testing*. [Behavior-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) tried to get that spirit back. What I heard Ian Cooper say in his [*TDD, Where Did It All Go Wrong*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM) talk was \"Write context tests.\"\n\nBasecamp's [*Shape Up*](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) is basically Alexander's ideas applied to product development and management. It makes a clear distinction between shaping (defining the problem and the context) and doing the work (creating a form). Which in turns allows a new dimension of diagnosis when a project fails: was the project badly shaped or is it that the execution failed and form was a bad fit?\n\nRyan Singer, head of strategy at Basecamp, did a great [intro to Alexander's work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLsTZXT0FlM) this summer. \n\n### The Best Writing\n\n[*Losing the War*](http://www.leesandlin.com/articles/LosingTheWar.htm) by Lee Sandlin is the best writing I read this year (and I read it on January 1, 2020).\nIt's an incredible essay on war (the Second World One), and memories. I found the \"flow\" to be exemplary with plenty of historical context and commentary. Well worth the time.\n\n### `programming == cooking`\n\nI used to tell students that I was \"teaching them how to fish.\" But after reading Robin Sloan’s [*Home Cooked App*](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/), I’ve started telling people I'm teaching them how to cook. It’s a *much richer* analogy. \n\nIf you don’t know how to cook, you eat pre-packaged meals or you eat out (or you live with your mom forever). But there are tons of reasons to want to learn how to cook and tons of things to do once you've learned how. You can cook for health reasons, to please friends, to create the perfect version of something, as a creative output, because you're picky, to make food you want to eat, because it's fun. You can specialize and become a baker, or open a taco truck, or start a family restaurant, or run a fine-dining restaurant. You can teach others how to cook. In the end, you can still go out and eat if you want, *you have a choice*. There are so many reasons to learn to cook.\n\nIf you don't know how to program (or how to reason about programming) you use  apps you bought and hire consultants. But there are tons of reasons to want to learn how to program and tons of things to do once you've learned how. You can create little scripts to rename files, write notebooks to make custom analyzes, write an app to enable friends and colleagues to explore data like you can, write your own text editor (!) because vim is holding you back, because it's fun. You can specialize and build deep learning models, or design data management systems, or build custom web apps, or start a scientific software development consultancy. You can teach others how to program. In the end, you can still hire consultants if you want, *you have a choice*. There are so many reasons to learn to program.\n\n\n### \\#techtalk\n\nThe [Glamorous Toolkit](https://gtoolkit.com) is an impressive \"moldable development environment\". I'd describe it as a strange hybrid between a notebook editor and an IDE. Any objects can have a rich and interactive representations, which is not new (to us), but the cool part is that it's easy to dynamically add new rich representations to the development environment. Watch this [talk by Tudor Gîrba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=Pot9GnHFOVU) to get a taste of what's possible.\n\nSimon Willison's (co-creator of Django) [Datasette](https://datasette.io) is an impressive project to \"explore and publish data\". It relies heavily on sqlite. I look forward to playing with it some more over the holidays. He's done super cool things with it, including finding the [best photo of a pelican according to Apple Photos](http://simonwillison.net/2020/May/21/dogsheep-photos/), and [building a regex search engine across a collection of Github repos using `ripgrep`](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Nov/28/datasette-ripgrep/).\n\n\n### \\#book-club\n\nI started many books this year, but didn't finish that many:\n\n- [*Thinking in Systems*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems) by Donella Meadows is a short introduction to \"systems thinking,\" their components (stocks, flows, feedback loops), common system configurations,  common pitfalls/opportunities of those configurations, and leverage points to intervene in those systems. I had so many \"Ah ha!\" moments. Many about things I \"knew\" but hadn't realized the consequences of. Like how \"systems with similar feedback structures produce similar dynamic behaviors, even if the outward appearance of these systems is completely dissimilar.\" For example, a population system (controlled by births and deaths) has a similar configuration as an economic capital system (controlled by investment and depreciation). Reading this book, it was so easy to think \"Here's a silver bullet!\" but then she totally called me out on it:\n\n\t> People who are raised in the industrial world and who get enthused about systems thinking are likely to make a terrible mistake. They are likely to assume that here, in systems analysis, in interconnection and complication, in the power of the computer, here at last, is the key to prediction and control. This mistake is likely because the mind-set of the industrial world assumes that there is a key to prediction and control.\n\n- [*Elements of Typographic Style*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44735.The_Elements_of_Typographic_Style) by Robert Bringhurst. Yes it's a typography book, but it may also be the funniest thing I read all year. Bonus: the book itself is a beautiful object.\n- [*Lab Girl*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733983-lab-girl) by Hope Jahren is a wonderful memoir of a \"life in science.\" She's a good storyteller, telling  a good story, about how the path to success in academia can be wild.\n\nBut I read a *lot* of good articles:\n\n- In [*Orthographic media*](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/orthographic/), Robin Sloan (him again) argues that social media is a little like an orthographic project (no perspective), you can't tell the relative importance of things. At least, not in the way that say, newspaper headlines conveyed that idea.\n- Sacha Judd makes the point that there *may* be [a diverse pipeline in tech](https://www.sachajudd.com/one-direction) and that people are not where \"we\" are looking for them. \n- The \"low tech\" internet described in this article by [Low Tech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/how-to-build-a-low-tech-internet.html) has caching and no assumption of synchronicity. It would make for a better \"high tech\" internet.\n- Paul Graham, [The Lesson to Unlearn](http://www.paulgraham.com/lesson.html).\n- Douglas Hofstadter writes about [*The Shallowness of Google Translate*](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/01/the-shallowness-of-google-translate/551570/). Did you know that Hofstadter is a translator?!\n- Dan Shapiro (CEO of Glowforge) writes [*Fellow White Dudes: Let’s Roll a d20*](https://www.danshapiro.com/blog/2019/02/fellow-white-dudes-lets-roll-a-d20/).\n- In [*Balancing Act: How to Capture Knowledge Without Killing It*](https://hbr.org/2000/05/balancing-act-how-to-capture-knowledge-without-killing-it) (HBR) John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid tell the story of Xerox's *Eureka* database and of the *community of practice* around it.\n\n\n### TYIL (This Year I Learned)\n\nThe [Ouarzazate Solar Power Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouarzazate_Solar_Power_Station) [melts salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_energy_storage#Molten_salt_technology) by concentrating the power of 7400 parabolic mirrors towards a central tower. The molten salt is then used to superheat water and power steam-powered generators.\n \nIt's possible to tell one's position in the sea based on wave patterns. The 2016 NYT piece by Kim Tingley, [_The Secrets of the Wave Pilots_](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/magazine/the-secrets-of-the-wave-pilots.html), is an impressive testament of what our brains can perceive using our full bodies as sensors. See also these beautiful [Marshall Islands navigation charts](https://kottke.org/20/02/marshall-islands-navigation-charts), and the [Eagle Eyes](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/segments/eagle-eyes) Radiolab story about the vest David Eagleman is building to help deaf people hear.\n\n### Some Nice Pandemic things\n\n- In May, the Barcelona Opera House reopened to a jam-packed audience. The hall was [filled with 2,292 plants](https://kottke.org/20/06/barcelona-opera-house-reopens-with-a-concert-for-2292-plants).\n- [*Inside King Arthur Flour, the Company Supplying America's Sudden Baking Obsession*](https://marker.medium.com/inside-the-flour-company-supplying-americas-sudden-baking-obsession-623034583579) by David H. Freedman. You knew King Arthur has a \"Baker's Hotline\", right?\n- [*The Virus is a Hawk*](https://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2020/07/birds-and-bad-science-ot.html) by Ctein. And we're ravens.\n- [*Solving the 'The Miracle Sudoku'*](https://kottke.org/20/05/solving-the-the-miracle-sudoku): you might have heard about this video in May. It's such a joyful thing.\n\n### Food\n\nI started making pizza just after the pandemic started. I can't wait for it to be over to organize pizza parties. My source of knowledge is Ken Forkish's [*Elements of Pizza*](https://kensartisan.com/elements-of-pizza/). Using [tipo 00 flour](https://www.thekitchn.com/what-is-00-flour-pizza-pasta-108281) is worth it. So is a baking steel/stone.\n\n[Kenji Alt Lopez’s Serious Eats episode on emulsions](https://www.seriouseats.com/2019/10/food-lab-video-episode-3-emulsions.html) has a really compelling demonstration of why you should put a *surfactant* in your emulsions. Now I put a little dollop of mustard in all my vinaigrettes.\n\n### Music\n\nMy friend Matt shared some *bardcore* videos by Hildegard von Blingin' earlier this year. Here's [*Somebody That I Used To Know (Bardcore/Medieval Style Cover with Vocals*)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch1aVmjvYTI). Bardcore is medieval renditions of pop songs. Obviously. So... the name Hildegard von Blingin’, is a reference to [Hildegard von Bingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hildegard_of_Bingen), an 11th century badass abbess, composer, and scientist (among others). In the early 2000, my mom gave me a CD by Garmarna, a Swedish band that does... electro-folk renditions of her 11th-century music.  `Hildegard von Blingin' = 1/Garmarna`! Here's [one song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSrRbDiWJE0) and here's [the whole Garmarna album](https://open.spotify.com/album/053oBAQKsQ8zdpn008LjbC?si=l2b7_oEiTVC5gwNSABSJMg).\n\n\nAccording to Spotify and Last.fm, I’ve listened to 1,700+ different artists this year, 600 of which were new to me. I won't give you the whole list, don't worry. Although I do have a playlist of [every album I liked in 2020](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7IIXpwAZn1iKZJ8rt6vicT?si=T_Tu-umdT9ixuggu5sca8g) and one of only the [best songs I listened to in 2020](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/176HkgMmoNjrQt166yk7Xl?si=N2o5sHqWRpyLstFh-zl1OQ).\n\n\nHere are my favorite albums _released in 2020_, in no particular order. \n\n- At the beginning of the pandemic, [Four Tet live streamed a set from a house in a forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXQi77eOdEY&app=desktop).

Great characters, surprisingly funny, great storylines and overall arc.\n- Ted Lasso is a close second.\n- [Crictor](https://www.crictor.ch/en) makes wonderful short, really short, videos. Do watch [*Popcorn*](https://www.crictor.ch/en/projects/popcorn) (15 sec) and [*Hanabi*](https://www.crictor.ch/en/projects/hanabi) (_fireworks_ in Japanese, a big 45 sec).\n- [*The Last Dance*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Dance_(miniseries)) ([Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/gb/Title/80203144)), on Michael Jordan's career was a riveting watch. I vividly remember the 1997 Utah game where Jordan \"had the flu\" and still scored 38 points. At the time, my English wasn't so great and I remembered being puzzled by the fact that the announcer said Jordan had \"the flu\" (which in  _québécois_ basically means diarrhea). Well, I learned that he probably _did_ have the runs! He didn't have the flu, he had food poisoning from a bad pizza probably given to him by disgruntled Jazz fans. Take that, Jazz!\n- [*The Good Place*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Place) ([Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80113701)) is an unlikely great show about… philosophy. My favorite character is Jason Mendoza. I'd watch it again.\n- [*The West Wing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing): got me into Sorkin. I shed a tear during 5 of the first 5 episodes. \n- I was going to say that [_The Magicians_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magicians_(American_TV_series)) was funny, smart, emotional, with a great cast, and a fantastic ending. But as I write this, I learned  there's a 5th season I didn't know existed. So take my \"great ending\" comment with a grain of salt.\n",

				"title": "Custom URL Handler for Files With Unique IDs",
				"content_html": "<p>Yesterday I read a <a href=\"https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/5609/\">series</a> <a href=\"https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/1121/open-files-in-any-app-from-the-archive-using-url-schemes\">of</a> <a href=\"https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/1152/using-a-custom-url-handler-on-macos-for-any-scripting-purpose\">posts</a> on custom URL scheme handlers on the <a href=\"https://forum.zettelkasten.de\">Zettelkasten forums</a>. The handler registers itself to open links like <code>zettel://202006061337</code>, where the number is the unique ID of a zettel (here it&rsquo;s a timestamp). I&rsquo;m not sure everyone realized the magnitude of what that means.</p>\n\n<p>Combining a custom URL with a unique ID means notes and links can become <em>entirely independent from your apps</em>. Only the handler needs to know about the apps you&rsquo;re using.</p>\n\n<p>That alone is very nice, but then I thought: URLs can have query parameters… That means I can have URLs like <code>zettel://202006061337&amp;edit</code> that open in my text editor of choice: <a href=\"https://macromates.com/\">TextMate</a>, <a href=\"https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit\">BBEdit</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom\">WriteRoom</a>, <a href=\"http://www.foldingtext.com/\">FoldingText</a>, etc. Or <code>zettel://202006061337&amp;preview</code> to open in <a href=\"https://marked2app.com/\">Marked</a>. Or I could even pick the app interactively with <code>zettel://202006061337&amp;pick</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Handling the ID alone is pretty easy since the common Zettelkasten-like apps respond to a URL scheme to search and open files. <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/help/#how-do-i-link-to-notes-from-other-apps\">The Archive</a> uses <code>thearchive://match/ID</code>, <a href=\"https://nvultra.com/help/advanced-features#urlhandler\">nvUltra</a> uses <code>x-nvultra://find/ID</code>, and <a href=\"https://brettterpstra.com/2012/02/02/connecting-nvalt-and-address-book/\">nvAlt</a> uses <code>nvalt://find/ID</code>.</p>\n\n<p>But how to open in a text editor or in Marked given only the ID? With Spotlight. I used <code>mdfind -name ID</code> to find the file. This could be further refined with the <code>-onlyin FOLDER</code> option but I didn&rsquo;t need it. Then it&rsquo;s a matter of calling <code>open -a Marked FILEPATH</code>.</p>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s also a <code>zettel://create</code> special case that will create a new zettel with the current time stamp (YYYYMMDDHHMM). It&rsquo;s always done with the default Zettelkasten app because the script doesn&rsquo;t know where to write the file but the app does.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote the handler in Applecript because it&rsquo;s the easiest way I know to create something that macOS considers an &ldquo;app&rdquo; and that can therefore handle URLs.</p>\n\n<p>The full script is below. To use it:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open Script Editor and paste the code below in a new file.</li>\n<li>[Optional] Modify values in the Configuration section to pick a different URL prefix, default Zettelkasten app URL, editor, and previewer. You can add as many apps as you&rsquo;d like in the <code>appChoices</code> array.</li>\n<li>Save as &ldquo;Application&rdquo;. You can save it anywhere. Make sure <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/245772/how-to-get-rid-of-applescript-confirmation\">none of the boxes are checked</a>.</li>\n<li>Register the app as a URL handler. You can do it with the <a href=\"https://github.com/Lord-Kamina/SwiftDefaultApps\">SwiftDefaultApps</a> Preference pane, or using the instructions provided by Christian Tietze <a href=\"https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/6133/#Comment_6133\">in the forums</a>:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Locate the application file you just created</li>\n<li>Right-click the app, select &ldquo;Show Package Contents&rdquo;</li>\n<li>Inside, open <code>Contents/Info.plist</code> <em>with a text editor</em></li>\n<li>Paste the following in a blank line right below the <code>&lt;dict&gt;</code> line. Replace <code>zettel</code> with the URL prefix you&rsquo;ve chosen:</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre style=\"background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-xml\" data-lang=\"xml\"><span style=\"color:#062873;font-weight:bold\">&lt;key&gt;</span>CFBundleURLTypes<span style=\"color:#062873;font-weight:bold\">&lt;/key&gt;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#062873;font-weight:bold\">&lt;array&gt;</span>\n    <span style=\"color:#062873;font-weight:bold\">&lt;dict&gt;</span>\n        <span style=\"color:#062873;font-weight:bold\">&lt;key&gt;</span>CFBundleURLName<span style=\"color:#062873;font-weight:bold\">&lt;/key&gt;</span>\n        <span style=\"color:#062873;font-weight:bold\">&lt;string&gt;</span>Zettel Link Opener<span style=\"color:#062873;font-weight:bold\">&lt;/string&gt;</span>\n        <span style=\"color:#062873;font-weight:bold\">&lt;key&gt;</span>CFBundleURLSchemes<span style=\"color:#062873;font-weight:bold\">&lt;/key&gt;</span>\n        <span style=\"color:#062873;font-weight:bold\">&lt;array&gt;</span>\n            <span style=\"color:#062873;font-weight:bold\">&lt;string&gt;</span>zettel<span style=\"color:#062873;font-weight:bold\">&lt;/string&gt;</span>\n        <span style=\"color:#062873;font-weight:bold\">&lt;/array&gt;</span>\n    <span style=\"color:#062873;font-weight:bold\">&lt;/dict&gt;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#062873;font-weight:bold\">&lt;/array&gt;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the full script:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre style=\"background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-applescript\" data-lang=\"applescript\"><span style=\"color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic\">-- Zettel Link Opener</span>\n<span style=\"color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic\">-- Created by Alexandre Chabot-Leclerc</span>\n<span style=\"color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic\">-- Source: https://alexchabot.net/2020/06/06/custom-url-handler-for-zettels/</span>\n<span style=\"color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic\">-- URL Handler for zettelkasten unique IDs, e.g., zettel://202006061017</span>\n<span style=\"color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic\">-- Handles options after the ID to open different apps:</span>\n<span style=\"color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic\">--    zettel://202006061017&amp;edit to open is a text editor like TextMate</span>\n<span style=\"color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic\">--    zettel://202006061017&amp;preview to open in a preview app like Marked</span>\n<span style=\"color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic\">--    zettel://202006061017&amp;pick to open a menu of apps to pick from</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic\">-----------------------------------------------------------</span>\n<span style=\"color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic\">-- CONFIGURATION</span>\n<span style=\"color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic\">-- URL prefix for your custom URL, e.g. zettel://ZETTEL_ID</span>\n<span style=\"color:#007020;font-weight:bold\">property</span> <span style=\"color:#bb60d5\">urlPrefix</span> : <span style=\"color:#4070a0\">&#34;zettel&#34;</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic\">-- Default URL to call to open a note with a given ID.

				"content_text": "Yesterday I read a [series](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/5609/) [of](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/1121/open-files-in-any-app-from-the-archive-using-url-schemes) [posts](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/1152/using-a-custom-url-handler-on-macos-for-any-scripting-purpose) on custom URL scheme handlers on the [Zettelkasten forums](https://forum.zettelkasten.de). The handler registers itself to open links like `zettel://202006061337`, where the number is the unique ID of a zettel (here it's a timestamp). I'm not sure everyone realized the magnitude of what that means. \n\nCombining a custom URL with a unique ID means notes and links can become _entirely independent from your apps_. Only the handler needs to know about the apps you're using. \n\nThat alone is very nice, but then I thought: URLs can have query parameters… That means I can have URLs like `zettel://202006061337&edit` that open in my text editor of choice: [TextMate](https://macromates.com/), [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit), [WriteRoom](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom), [FoldingText](http://www.foldingtext.com/), etc. Or `zettel://202006061337&preview` to open in [Marked](https://marked2app.com/). Or I could even pick the app interactively with `zettel://202006061337&pick`.\n\nHandling the ID alone is pretty easy since the common Zettelkasten-like apps respond to a URL scheme to search and open files. [The Archive](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/help/#how-do-i-link-to-notes-from-other-apps) uses `thearchive://match/ID`, [nvUltra](https://nvultra.com/help/advanced-features#urlhandler) uses `x-nvultra://find/ID`, and [nvAlt](https://brettterpstra.com/2012/02/02/connecting-nvalt-and-address-book/) uses `nvalt://find/ID`.\n\nBut how to open in a text editor or in Marked given only the ID? With Spotlight. I used `mdfind -name ID` to find the file. This could be further refined with the `-onlyin FOLDER` option but I didn't need it. Then it's a matter of calling `open -a Marked FILEPATH`.\n\nThere's also a `zettel://create` special case that will create a new zettel with the current time stamp (YYYYMMDDHHMM). It's always done with the default Zettelkasten app because the script doesn't know where to write the file but the app does.\n\nI wrote the handler in Applecript because it's the easiest way I know to create something that macOS considers an \"app\" and that can therefore handle URLs. \n\nThe full script is below. To use it:\n\n1. Open Script Editor and paste the code below in a new file.\n2. [Optional] Modify values in the Configuration section to pick a different URL prefix, default Zettelkasten app URL, editor, and previewer. You can add as many apps as you'd like in the `appChoices` array.\n3. Save as \"Application\". You can save it anywhere. Make sure [none of the boxes are checked](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/245772/how-to-get-rid-of-applescript-confirmation).\n4. Register the app as a URL handler. You can do it with the [SwiftDefaultApps](https://github.com/Lord-Kamina/SwiftDefaultApps) Preference pane, or using the instructions provided by Christian Tietze [in the forums](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/6133/#Comment_6133):\n\t- Locate the application file you just created\n\t- Right-click the app, select \"Show Package Contents\"\n\t- Inside, open `Contents/Info.plist` _with a text editor_\n\t- Paste the following in a blank line right below the `<dict>` line. Replace `zettel` with the URL prefix you've chosen:\n\n```xml\n<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>\n<array>\n    <dict>\n        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>\n        <string>Zettel Link Opener</string>\n        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>zettel</string>\n        </array>\n    </dict>\n</array>\n```\n\nHere's the full script:\n\n```applescript\n-- Zettel Link Opener\n-- Created by Alexandre Chabot-Leclerc\n-- Source: https://alexchabot.net/2020/06/06/custom-url-handler-for-zettels/\n-- URL Handler for zettelkasten unique IDs, e.g., zettel://202006061017\n-- Handles options after the ID to open different apps:\n--    zettel://202006061017&edit to open is a text editor like TextMate\n--    zettel://202006061017&preview to open in a preview app like Marked\n--    zettel://202006061017&pick to open a menu of apps to pick from\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n-- CONFIGURATION\n-- URL prefix for your custom URL, e.g. zettel://ZETTEL_ID\nproperty urlPrefix : \"zettel\"\n\n-- Default URL to call to open a note with a given ID.

The `%matplotlib` function had already been introduced in a [2013 refactoring](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/commit/7ae1fe4225c0c11ccdd6eec758c23aa81ac88654) to separate the interatice plotting from the imports. The `%gui` magic command had already been [introduced](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/commit/a38045e05d22fee06a56ae884856ed689523ff7b) in 2009 by Brian Granger to \"manage the events loops\" (hint hint).\n\nNow we know that the (my) confusion with `%gui` and `%matplotlib` started in 2013. \n\nThis analysis refers to [IPython 7.8.0](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/tree/7.8.0) and [ipykernel 5.1.2](https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/tree/v5.1.2).\n\nOur entry point will be the `%matplotlib` magic command. Its source code is in the [`IPython.core.pylab.py`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/c233c25ab8b724646b9bdc407214c3bb7294683c/IPython/core/magics/pylab.py#L46-L100) file. The essential call is to `shell.enable_matplotlib(gui)`, which is itself implemented in [`IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/c233c25ab8b724646b9bdc407214c3bb7294683c/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py#L3380-L3423), and does five things:\n\n1. **Select the \"backend\" given the choice of GUI event loop.** This is done by calling [`IPython.core.pylabtools.find_gui_and_backend(gui)`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/c233c25ab8b724646b9bdc407214c3bb7294683c/IPython/core/pylabtools.py#L259-L299). It encapsulates the logic to go\nfrom a GUI name, like `\"qt5\"` or `\"tk\"`, to a backend name, like `\"Qt5Agg\"` and  `\"TkAgg\"`.\n2. **Activate matplotlib for interactive use** by calling [`IPython.core.pylabtools.activate_matplotlib(backend)`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/c233c25ab8b724646b9bdc407214c3bb7294683c/IPython/core/pylabtools.py#L302-L323), which:\n\t 1. Activates the interactive mode with `matplotlib.interactive(True)`; \n\t 2. Switches to the  new backend with `matplotlib.pyplot.switch_backend(backend)`;\n\t 3. Replaces the `matplotlib.pyplot.draw_if_interactive` method with the same method, but wrapped by a `flag_calls` decorator, which adds a `called` flag to the method. That flag will be used by the new `%run` runner that's introduced below at point #5;\n3. **Configure inline figure support** by calling [`IPython.core.pylabtools.configure_inline_support(shell, backend)`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/c233c25ab8b724646b9bdc407214c3bb7294683c/IPython/core/pylabtools.py#L359-L415). This is where some very interesting stuff happens. It first checks that `InlineBackend` is actually importable from [`ipykernel.pylab.backend_inline`](https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/blob/v5.1.2/ipykernel/pylab/backend_inline.py), otherwise it returns immediately. But if it's importable and the backend is `\"inline\"`, it:\n\t1. Imports the [`ipykernel.pylab.backend_inline.flush_figures`](https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/blob/ae9ebd0da9cff1b9a5fd6e409c0de44892da9100/ipykernel/pylab/backend_inline.py#L100-L143) function, and register it as a callback for the `\"post_execute\"` event of the shell. As we'll see later, callbacks for `\"post_execute\"` are called after executing every cell;\n\t2. If the backend was _not_ `\"inline\"`, it'll unregister the `flush_figures` callback;\n4. **Enable the GUI by calling [`shell.enable_gui(gui)`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/c233c25ab8b724646b9bdc407214c3bb7294683c/IPython/terminal/interactiveshell.py#L515-L521).** This method is not implemented in the `IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell` base class, but rather in `IPython.terminal.interactiveshell.TerminalInteractiveShell`. If a `gui` as specified, it gets the name of the `active_eventloop` and its corresponding `inputhook` function using [`IPython.terminal.pt_intputhooks.get_inputhook_name_and_func(gui)`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/c233c25ab8b724646b9bdc407214c3bb7294683c/IPython/terminal/pt_inputhooks/__init__.py#L33-L49). The `active_eventloop` is just a string, such as `'qt'`, but the `inputhook` is more interesting. It's the function to call to start that GUI toolkit's event loop. Let's dig further into `get_inputhook_name_and_func(gui)`. That function checks a few things, but it essentially:\n\t1. Imports the correct `inputhook` function for the chosen GUI by importing it from [`IPython.terminal.pt_intputhooks.<gui_mod>`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/tree/7.8.0/IPython/terminal/pt_inputhooks). For example, the Qt `inputhook` is imported from [`IPython.terminal.pt_intputhooks.qt`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/7.8.0/IPython/terminal/pt_inputhooks/qt.py).  Later on, when [`inputhook` is executed for Qt](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/c233c25ab8b724646b9bdc407214c3bb7294683c/IPython/terminal/pt_inputhooks/qt.py#L11-L53), it will:\n\t\t1. Create a [`QCoreApplication`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qcoreapplication.html);\n\t\t2. Create a [`QEventLoop`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qeventloop.html) for that application;\n\t\t3. Execute the event loop and register the right events to make sure the loop is shut down properly. The exact operations to start and stop the loop are slightly different for other GUI toolkits, like `tk`, `wx`, or `osx`,  but they all essentially do the same thing. At this point we're ready to go back up the stack to `enable_matplotlib` in `%matplotlib`;\n5. **Replace IPython's `default_runner` with the one defined in [`IPython.core.pylabtools.mpl_runner`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/c233c25ab8b724646b9bdc407214c3bb7294683c/IPython/core/pylabtools.py#L145-L192).** The `default_runner` is the function that executes code when using the `%run` magic. The `mpl_runner`:\n\t1. Saves the `matplotlib.interactive` state, and disables it;\n\t2. Executes the file;\n\t3. Restores the `interactive` state;\n\t4. Makes the rendering call, if the user asked for it, by checking the `plt.draw_if_interactive.called` flag that was introduced at point #1.3 above.\n\nAs for the other magic, [`%gui`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/c233c25ab8b724646b9bdc407214c3bb7294683c/IPython/core/magics/basic.py#L468-L501), it only executes a subset of what `%matplotlib` does. It only calls `shell.enable_gui(gui)`, which is point #4 above. This means that if your application requires interaction with a GUI's event loop, but doesn't require matplotlib, then it's sufficient to use `%gui`. For example, if you're writing applications using [TraitsUI](https://docs.enthought.com/traitsui/) or [PyQt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro/).\n\n### The Effect of Calling `%gui` and `%matplotlib`\n\nLet's start with the \"simplest\" one, `%gui`. If you execute it in a fresh IPython session, it'll only start the event loop. On macOS, the obvious effect of this is to start the Rocket icon.\n\n![Animation of the Python rocket icon starting because of a call to `%gui`.](https://alexchabot.micro.blog/uploads/2020/cac6643296.gif)\n\nAt that point, if you import matplotlib and call `plt.plot()`, no figure will appear unless you either call `plt.show()` afterwards, or manually enable interactive mode with `plt.interactive(True)`.\n\nOn the other hand, if you start your session by calling `%matplotlib`, it'll start the Rocket _and_ activate matplotlib's interactive mode. This way, if you call `plt.plot()`, your figure will show up immediately and your session will not be blocked.\n\n### Using `%run`\n\nIf you call `%run my_script.py`  _after_ calling `%matplotlib`, `my_script.py` will be executed with the [`mpl_runner`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/c233c25ab8b724646b9bdc407214c3bb7294683c/IPython/core/pylabtools.py#L145-L192) introduced above at point #5.\n\n### Executing a Jupyter Notebok Cell When Using the `\"inline\"` Backend\n\nIn the terminal the [`IPython.terminal.interactiveshell.TerminalInteractiveShell.interact()`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/c233c25ab8b724646b9bdc407214c3bb7294683c/IPython/terminal/interactiveshell.py#L471-L489) method is where all the fun stuff happens. It prompts you for code, checks if you want to exit, and then executes the cell with [`InteractiveShell.run_cell(code)`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/c233c25ab8b724646b9bdc407214c3bb7294683c/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py#L2828-L2860) and _then_ trigger the `\"post_execute\"` event for which we've registered the `ipykernel.pylab.backend_inline.flush_figures` callback. As you might have noticed, the `flush_figures` function comes from ipykernel, and not from IPython. It tries to return all the figures produced by the cell as PNG of SVG, displays them on screen using IPython's [`display`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/c233c25ab8b724646b9bdc407214c3bb7294683c/IPython/core/display.py#L131-L315) function, and then closes all the figures, so matplotlib doesn't end up littered will all the figures we've ever plotted.\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo sum it up, use `%matplotlib` if you want interactive plotting with matplotlib. If you're only interested in the GUI's event loop, `%gui <backend>` is sufficient._ Although as far as I understand, there's nothing very wrong with using `%matplotlib` all the time.\n",

It features a Chinese company named Haier, which is the worlds largest appliance maker with $35 billon/year in revenue. The business is structured around  4,000 independent microentreprises (MEs) made of 10 to 15 employees. Each ME provides different of services to other MEs: marketing, R&amp;D, design, manufacturing, HR, etc. Each ME is free to contract with any other ME, or go to an external provider if they don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d be well served internally. It&rsquo;s a setup that flies in the face of pretty much any other large company. Definitely worth a read.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"good-reads\">Good Reads</h3>\n\n<p>Dan Barber (chef and co-owner of Blue Hill at Stone Barns) writes <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/07/opinion/sunday/dan-barber-seed-companies.html\"><em>Save Our Food. Free the Seed.</em></a> at the NYT. It&rsquo;s an inspiring, and also infuriating, article about seeds and how they&rsquo;re at the root of our entire food supply chain. I didn&rsquo;t realize that seed &ldquo;designers&rdquo; make their seeds work hand in hand with insecticides, which are often made by <em>the same</em> companies (e.g., Monsanto). That wouldn&rsquo;t matter too much if we weren&rsquo;t down to just two mega seed producers, and if the seeds weren&rsquo;t patented.</p>\n\n<p>I still haven&rsquo;t read any of Michael Lewis&rsquo; books (somehow), but every time I read one of his articles I&rsquo;m completely sucked in. Here are two good ones I read this year. In <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/25/magazine/25STOCK-TRADER.html?pagewanted=all&amp;pagewanted=print\"><em>Jonathan Lebed&rsquo;s Extracurricular Activities</em></a>, Lewis tells the story of a 15-year old &ldquo;stock manipulator.&rdquo; In <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-10-15/lifesaving-coast-guard-scientist-reflects-on-government-service\"><em>Portrait of an Inessential Government Worker</em></a> talks about Art Allen, the only oceanographer inside the U.S. Coast Guard’s Search and Rescue division, and the person who&rsquo;s basically single-handedly responsible for mankind&rsquo;s ability to find things lost a sea. Lewis also started a podcast this year called <a href=\"https://atrpodcast.com\">Against the Grain</a>. Recommended.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://craigmod.com/essays/media_accounting/\"><em>Stab a Book, the Book Won&rsquo;t Die</em></a> Craig Mod (real name) speaks of different forms of content and their respective &ldquo;contracts&rdquo; with their consumers. Books have edges, a clear &ldquo;I buy you, I read you or I don&rsquo;t&rdquo; contract. Online publications, like Netflix, Twitter, and Instagram don&rsquo;t have such clear contracts. They&rsquo;re <a href=\"https://maketime.blog/article/distractions-are-a-nuisance-but-infinity-pools-are-the-real-problem/\"><em>infinity pools</em></a>. I really liked his observation that with print newspapers, only the front page (often just above the fold) needs sensational headlines to get people to buy it. Internal headlines can afford to be factual. Online, all headlines are on the front page.</p>\n\n<p>Cormac McCarthy, in his &ldquo;free time&rdquo;, does editing for faculty and post docs at the Santa Fe Institute. Van Savage and Pamela Yeh publish <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02918-5\">McCarthy&rsquo;s advice on writing scientific papers</a> at Nature. It&rsquo;s equally good advice for writing documentations and reports.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system\">Japanese addressing system</a> is strange and wonderful. When written in Japanese, the addresses start with the largest geographical entity and proceed to the most specific one.</p>\n\n<p>Someone who&rsquo;s name I can&rsquo;t figure out writes <a href=\"https://autotranslucence.wordpress.com/2018/03/30/becoming-a-magician/\"><em>Becoming a magician</em></a>, with an interesting approach to &ldquo;personal growth&rdquo;: surround yourself with people who feel to you like they&rsquo;re magicians.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"technology-software\">Technology &amp; Software</h3>\n\n<p>Julia Evans’ <a href=\"https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/06/23/a-few-debugging-resources/\"><em>What does debugging a program look like?</em></a> is a great read about the multiple ways to approach debugging. Julia started writing <a href=\"https://wizardzines.com\">zines</a> full-time this year. If you’re interested in having a look, I have one on my desk. And on the topic of debugging, Greg Wilson recommends <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Why-Programs-Fail-Systematic-Debugging/dp/0123745152\"><em>Why Programs Fail: A Guide to Systematic Debugging</em></a> by Andreas Zeller.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/richhickey/1563cddea1002958f96e7ba9519972d9\"><em>Open Source is not about you</em></a>, Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure, writes a wonderful article about expectations one should have about open source software (I still find strange people who “blog” using Github repos and Gists&hellip;)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>As a user of something open source you are not thereby entitled to anything at all. You are not entitled to contribute. You are not entitled to features. You are not entitled to the attention of others. You are not entitled to having value attached to your complaints. You are not entitled to this explanation.</p>\n\n<p>If you have expectations (of others) that aren’t being met, those expectations are your own responsibility. You are responsible for your own needs. If you want things, make them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And on a related topic, License Zero has a thoughtful look at <a href=\"https://blog.licensezero.com/2019/08/26/but-you-said.html\">funding models for open source</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I award &ldquo;Data Structure of the Year&rdquo; to Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). I learned about them through Ink and Switch’s article <a href=\"https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html\"><em>Local-first software: You own your data, in spite of the cloud</em></a>, where they use them to write a real-time syncing engine that doesn’t require a central server. But then, in pure <a href=\"https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/human-brain/baader-meinhof-phenomenon.htm\">Baader–Meinhof</a>, it seemed like everyone was talking about them, e.g., the <a href=\"https://www.recurse.com/events/localhost-raph-levien\">Xi editor</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/\">Figma</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Basecamp published <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/shapeup\"><em>Shape Up</em></a>, the “manual” for their software development process. It’s a 1-hour read that I highly recommend. It’s a variation on Agile, with thoughtful additions, structures, and rationales for why the do things in certain ways.</p>\n\n<p>Lowtech Magazine hosts their website on a <a href=\"https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website/\">solar-powered Raspberry Pi</a>.

Free the Seed._](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/07/opinion/sunday/dan-barber-seed-companies.html) at the NYT. It's an inspiring, and also infuriating, article about seeds and how they're at the root of our entire food supply chain. I didn't realize that seed \"designers\" make their seeds work hand in hand with insecticides, which are often made by *the same* companies (e.g., Monsanto). That wouldn't matter too much if we weren't down to just two mega seed producers, and if the seeds weren't patented. \n\nI still haven't read any of Michael Lewis' books (somehow), but every time I read one of his articles I'm completely sucked in. Here are two good ones I read this year. In [_Jonathan Lebed's Extracurricular Activities_](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/25/magazine/25STOCK-TRADER.html?pagewanted=all&pagewanted=print), Lewis tells the story of a 15-year old \"stock manipulator.\" In [_Portrait of an Inessential Government Worker_](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-10-15/lifesaving-coast-guard-scientist-reflects-on-government-service) talks about Art Allen, the only oceanographer inside the U.S. Coast Guard’s Search and Rescue division, and the person who's basically single-handedly responsible for mankind's ability to find things lost a sea. Lewis also started a podcast this year called [Against the Grain](https://atrpodcast.com). Recommended.\n\nIn [_Stab a Book, the Book Won't Die_](https://craigmod.com/essays/media_accounting/) Craig Mod (real name) speaks of different forms of content and their respective \"contracts\" with their consumers. Books have edges, a clear \"I buy you, I read you or I don't\" contract. Online publications, like Netflix, Twitter, and Instagram don't have such clear contracts. They're [*infinity pools*](https://maketime.blog/article/distractions-are-a-nuisance-but-infinity-pools-are-the-real-problem/). I really liked his observation that with print newspapers, only the front page (often just above the fold) needs sensational headlines to get people to buy it. Internal headlines can afford to be factual. Online, all headlines are on the front page. \n\nCormac McCarthy, in his \"free time\", does editing for faculty and post docs at the Santa Fe Institute. Van Savage and Pamela Yeh publish [McCarthy's advice on writing scientific papers](http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02918-5) at Nature. It's equally good advice for writing documentations and reports.\n\nThe [Japanese addressing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system) is strange and wonderful. When written in Japanese, the addresses start with the largest geographical entity and proceed to the most specific one.\n\nSomeone who's name I can't figure out writes [_Becoming a magician_](https://autotranslucence.wordpress.com/2018/03/30/becoming-a-magician/), with an interesting approach to \"personal growth\": surround yourself with people who feel to you like they're magicians.\n\n### Technology & Software\n\nJulia Evans’ [_What does debugging a program look like?_](https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/06/23/a-few-debugging-resources/) is a great read about the multiple ways to approach debugging. Julia started writing [zines](https://wizardzines.com) full-time this year. If you’re interested in having a look, I have one on my desk. And on the topic of debugging, Greg Wilson recommends [_Why Programs Fail: A Guide to Systematic Debugging_](https://www.amazon.com/Why-Programs-Fail-Systematic-Debugging/dp/0123745152) by Andreas Zeller. \n\n\nIn [_Open Source is not about you_](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/1563cddea1002958f96e7ba9519972d9), Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure, writes a wonderful article about expectations one should have about open source software (I still find strange people who “blog” using Github repos and Gists...)\n\n> As a user of something open source you are not thereby entitled to anything at all. You are not entitled to contribute. You are not entitled to features. You are not entitled to the attention of others. You are not entitled to having value attached to your complaints. You are not entitled to this explanation.\n>\n> If you have expectations (of others) that aren’t being met, those expectations are your own responsibility. You are responsible for your own needs. If you want things, make them.\n\nAnd on a related topic, License Zero has a thoughtful look at [funding models for open source](https://blog.licensezero.com/2019/08/26/but-you-said.html).\n\nI award \"Data Structure of the Year\" to Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). I learned about them through Ink and Switch’s article [_Local-first software: You own your data, in spite of the cloud_](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html), where they use them to write a real-time syncing engine that doesn’t require a central server. But then, in pure [Baader–Meinhof](https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/human-brain/baader-meinhof-phenomenon.htm), it seemed like everyone was talking about them, e.g., the [Xi editor](https://www.recurse.com/events/localhost-raph-levien), and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/).\n\nBasecamp published [_Shape Up_](https://basecamp.com/shapeup), the “manual” for their software development process. It’s a 1-hour read that I highly recommend. It’s a variation on Agile, with thoughtful additions, structures, and rationales for why the do things in certain ways.\n\nLowtech Magazine hosts their website on a [solar-powered Raspberry Pi](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website/). Warning, their site might be down when you visit if it's been cloudy for a while in Barcelona. Roel Roscam Abbing wrote about [the technical details](https://homebrewserver.club/low-tech-website-howto.html).\n\nJakob Nielsen explains [_Why You Only Need to Test with 5 Users_](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/).\n\nHere are some people I discovered this year.  They are _so inspiring_, and also _so frustrating_, because they make you wonder \"And what have _I_ done today?\"\n\n- [Devine Lu Linvega](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#home) (warning, you'll probably get lost for a while on this site) and [Rekka Bell](https://kokorobot.ca/#home) live on a sailboat and travel the world. They make their own [games](https://100r.co/pages/games.html), [tools](https://100r.co/pages/tools.html), [books](https://100r.co/pages/books.html), [recipes](https://grimgrains.com/#home). Both have done a Uses This interview: [Rekka](https://usesthis.com/interviews/rekka.bell/), [Devine](https://usesthis.com/interviews/devine.lu.linvega/). \n- [Tristan Hume](https://thume.ca/) just graduate from an undergrad in CS and built [ray tracers](https://thume.ca/ray-tracer-site/), [syntax highlighters](https://github.com/trishume/syntect), and contributes to a [deep-learning auto-completion tool](https://tabnine.com). He nows works at Jane Street, where he recently wrote about a [font patched to make it easier to read big numbers](https://blog.janestreet.com/commas-in-big-numbers-everywhere/).\n- I didn't _discover_ Stephen Wolfram this year, but his [_Seeking the Productive Life: Some Details of My Personal Infrastructure_](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/) is an impressive description of how he gets work done, and how he designed and built software and hardware (and arguably a company) to solve his needs.\n\n### Podcasts\n\nMy \"Podcast of the Year\" is the [_The Amelia Project_](https://ameliapodcast.com/listen-now), a fiction podcast about Amelia, an organization that helps clients fake their death and then reappear as whatever they want. It's original, beautifully produced, endearing, and funny. Do start with the 1st episode, and go get yourself a hot cocoa. And if you're new to fiction podcasts, check out [_Limetown_](https://twoupproductions.com/limetown/podcast), and [_Passenger List_](https://passengerlist.org).\n\n\nMichael Lopp (author of [_Managing Humans_](https://www.biblio.com/9781484221570), which was in last year's email) has a podcast called _The Important Thing_. If you're interested in management and leadership, I recommend the [_The One About Management (Pt. 1)_](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-one-about-management-pt-1/) and [_The One About Management (Pt. 2)_](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-one-about-management-pt-2/) for a good discussion of what it means and what it's like to be a manager.\n\nThe [_Nevermore, Amazon_](https://rework.fm/nevermore-amazon/) episode of Rework (by Basecamp), talks about about the economics of bookstores, and how selling new hardcovers for $15 (like Amazon does) would put them out of business. Independent bookstores are the best. If you prefer the convenience of shopping online but want to support independent bookstores, use [Biblio](http://biblio.com). Cool fact: they offset the carbon emissions of their shipping.\n\n### Food, Drinks & Restaurants\n\nFor the Austinites, and people visiting Austin, go eat at:\n\n- [Nixta Taqueria](https://www.nixtataqueria.com): yes, they're hipster tacos, but they're also delicious.\n- [Launderette](https://launderetteaustin.com) is still our favorite restaurant in Austin. Laura Sawicki is the best pastry chef in town.\n- Get ice cream at [Manoli's](https://www.manolisusa.com). Just do it.\n- Everything I drank from [Vista Brewing](https://vistabrewingtx.com) this year was delicious.\n- Get some pastries at [Le Politique's Patisserie](https://lepolitiqueaustin.com/patisserie). I recommend scheduling your afternoon coffee break for the 3–4PM window, when pastries are half price.\n- I finally went to a [Home Slice](https://homeslicepizza.com/location/north-loop/) and it's really that good.\n- [Bombay Express](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bombay+Express/@30.4111428,-97.6760472,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x8644cec75df19185:0x429c6dd5b3a0a759!8m2!3d30.4111428!4d-97.6760472) makes delicious india food. Get the pani puri, and the chole puri, and the carrot halwa, and a dosa, and... get all the things. It's worth going on the weekend just for the Thali.\n\nMake bread at home. It's easy and it's better than anything you can get in Austin (except maybe from [Sour Duck](https://www.sourduckmarket.com), and from the late [Miche Bread](http://www.michebread.com)). Just buy [_Flour Water Salt Yeast_](https://www.kensartisan.com/flour-water-salt-yeast) by Ken Forkish, and make the Saturday Overnight White bread. Bring the extra loaf to the office, please.\n\n### Music\n\nIt was a good year. It's always a good year. Here's a playlist of [every song I \"liked\" in 2019](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1yCawiBOW4va3JfowbIZDM?si=qXCK_SarQ_OUHANMiGtosA), and one of [every album](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/40RzwL8tcUTpYDTFfpW8Ed?si=RqXsJRuWSwypVldZLP4AoA). The music on those playlists wasn't necessarily released in 2019 though. Just to name a few albums that _were_ release in 2019:\n\n- Charlie Hunter and Lucy Woodward - Music!Music!Music!

It's funny, beautiful, and strange.\n\n- [_The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marvelous_Mrs._Maisel) and [_Killing Eve_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Eve) were the two best series we watched this year. One great quality of _Killing Eve_ is that it _ends_, in only two seasons.\n- [Simple Made Easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) by Rich Hickey. Simple is the not the same as easy.\n\n- In his 2019 [State of Mozilla](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2019/10/23/the-state-of-mozilla-2019/) talk, Mike Hoye makes this wonderful point about caring about making it _possible_ to care.  Paraphrasing from his talk: There's no Keurig machine in the Toronto office because there's no amount of care that will make it produce good coffee. I like that a lot (coffee, but also this statement).\n",

[&hellip;] It sounds like most folks picture leveling up as a little avatar of themselves advancing up a ladder of 20 levels, moving up to the next rung incrementally as they gain experience. This creates this visual of our skills improving linearly with our time spent in tech. I’ll henceforth call this the ladder interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>I pictured, instead, what I will call the derivative interpretation. It comprises a series of maybe three levels.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Level One: Getting better, adding skills</li>\n<li>Level Two: Improving at getting better/adding skills</li>\n<li>Level Three: Getting better techniques for improving at getting better/adding skills</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Heroku folks published <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46\">12 Factor CLI Apps</a> a follow up of sort to their <a href=\"https://12factor.net/\">12 Factor (web) App</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I think if there’s one technology we should be &ldquo;concerned&rdquo; or excited about, as Python users, it’s Javascript (there are many reasons to be afraid, I know). This year, Michael Droettboom <a href=\"http://droettboom.com/blog/2018/04/04/python-in-the-browser/\">compiled NumPy to WebAssembly</a>.

				"content_text": "This is the 2nd installment of an email I sent to my Enthought colleagues just before the Christmas holidays. The other installment is [2017](https://alexchabot.net/2021/12/17/211935.html).\n\n---\n\nHi everyone,\n\nThis is installment #2 of Alex’s annual Holidays newsletter. I decided to send it company-wide this year. It’s a collection of interesting reads/listens/_watchs_ I \"consumed\" this year.\n\n## Programming & Technology\n\nGetting better at it:\n\n  * [My Approach to Getting Dramatically Better as a Programmer – malisper.me](https://malisper.me/my-approach-to-getting-dramatically-better-as-a-programmer/)\n  * Chelsey Troy writes my new favorite technical blog. She has a series called [Leveling Up: A Guide for Programming](https://chelseatroy.com/2018/04/20/leveling-up-a-guide-for-programmers/)\n\n> I found out what people meant by level up about three and a half years into my programming career when I played my first game of Dungeons and Dragons. [...] It sounds like most folks picture leveling up as a little avatar of themselves advancing up a ladder of 20 levels, moving up to the next rung incrementally as they gain experience. This creates this visual of our skills improving linearly with our time spent in tech. I’ll henceforth call this the ladder interpretation.\n> \n> I pictured, instead, what I will call the derivative interpretation. It comprises a series of maybe three levels.\n> \n>   * Level One: Getting better, adding skills\n>   * Level Two: Improving at getting better/adding skills\n>   * Level Three: Getting better techniques for improving at getting better/adding skills\n\n  * The Heroku folks published [12 Factor CLI Apps](https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46) a follow up of sort to their [12 Factor (web) App](https://12factor.net/).\n\nI think if there’s one technology we should be \"concerned\" or excited about, as Python users, it’s Javascript (there are many reasons to be afraid, I know). This year, Michael Droettboom [compiled NumPy to WebAssembly](http://droettboom.com/blog/2018/04/04/python-in-the-browser/). The project is called [pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide)\n\n  * [How bad is the Windows command line really?](http://blog.nullspace.io/batch.html). Spoiler: quite bad. Not sure if it’s [as bad as PHP](https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/).\n\n## Management\n\nAs a newly minted manager, I read quite a few management books this year. Here are my favorites. I _highly_ recommend reading Managing Humans, even if you’re not a manager.\n\n  * First Time Manager: A high-level overview of what the new responsibilities are.\n  * [Managing Humans](https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/1484221575/) by Michael Lopp aka [Rands](http://randsinrepose.com/). Now at Slack, previously at Palantir and Apple, he is an amazing storyteller. The story form also makes the lessons stick better.\n  * High Output Management by Andy Grove, Intel CEO. Ian Tien wrote a [good summary](https://medium.com/@iantien/top-takeaways-from-andy-grove-s-high-output-management-2e0ecfb1ea63). It's often quoted as the source of much of modern management in tech companies.\n  * [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team) by Patrick Lencioni. It’s a fable about management and leading a team. It’s a bit corny, and yet it was a page-turner.\n  * [It's Your Ship: Management Techniques from the Best Damn Ship in the Navy](https://www.amazon.com/Its-Your-Ship-Management-Techniques/dp/1594831963) by D. Michael Abrashoff. Don’t let the title (and the cover) fool you, it’s great. Not all lessons apply to the Enthought, but it’s amazing what he managed to do _in the Navy_.\n\n## Reads\n\n  * [Fermi Estimates by Luke Muehlhauser on Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/lw/h5e/fermi_estimates/): Fermi estimation is when you try to find a reasonable value for something you know nothing about, e.g., how many car dealerships are there in the US? The most interesting trick was to use the geometric mean of the lower and upper limits for a value, instead picking some random number in the middle.\n  * As much as I love good-looking graphs and visualization, I hate \"Data Visualization.\" It’s mostly good looking and not informative. [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) is the only exception I’ve found. Some good ones [The largest vocabulary in hip hop](https://pudding.cool/2017/02/vocabulary/), [Are pop lyrics getting more repetitive](https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition/), [Listen to Her: Gender on This American Life](https://pudding.cool/2017/09/this-american-life) and the very-clear [Women’s Pockets are Inferior](https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/)\n  * [The Cube Rule of Food, the Grand Unified Theory of Food Identification](https://kottke.org/18/12/the-cube-rule-of-food-the-grand-unified-theory-of-food-identification)\n  * [The 3 Kinds of Non Fiction books](http://commoncog.com/blog/the-3-kinds-of-non-fiction-book/)\n  * [Japan’s Hometown Tax](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2018/10/19/japanese-hometown-tax/) by Patrick (patio11 on HN)\n  * [Uber, Lyft, Taxis, Design and the Age of Ambivalence](https://www.subtraction.com/2018/10/08/uber-lyft-taxis-design-the-age-of-ambivalence/) by Koi Vinh\n  * [How Sevilla Became a Bicycle City in Just 18 Months](https://kottke.org/18/11/how-sevilla-became-a-bicycle-city-in-just-18-months) by Jason Kottke. Austin can do it to. Actually, most cities could do this. On a related note, [Fresh evidence for Portland’s green dividend](http://cityobservatory.org/fresh-evidence-for-portlands-green-dividend/) shows there’s actually a large financial benefit to public transit and bikes.\n  * Fun examples of marginalia, [Reading with a pencil](https://austinkleon.com/2018/08/30/reading-with-a-pencil/) by Austin Kleon (who happens to live in Austin).\n\n## Podcasts\n\nYou know, there has to be a section about podcasts!\n\n  * [This American Life - NUMMI](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/403/nummi): It’s from a few years back but it’s relevant to us, to what Enthought is doing with JSR/TEL/AK/Exxon. It’s the story of the NUMMI plant, a joint venture between GM and Toyota, of the transformative experience of the immersion process, and about what do to with the people who _did not_ go through the immersion process.\n  * New York Times - The Caliphate a fascinating story by Brokmini, who’s been following ISIS for years. It should be more widely known. It’s leaps and bounds better than Serial.\n  * [99% Invisible - 330 - Raccoon Resistance](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/raccoon-resistance/) on the design of Toronto’s raccoons-resistant compost bins. 99pi at its best. Funny and informative.\n  * [The Dollop - 342 - The John Paul Getty’s](http://thedollop.libsyn.com/342-the-john-paul-gettys-live-in-minneapolis): a hysterical account of the Getty family (yes, the museum Getty’s).\n  * [The knowledge project - The Kids are Worth It with Barbara Coloroso](https://fs.blog/barbara-coloroso/). I’m not a parent, but if I were I’d probably re-listen to this once a week until my kids are 18.\n  * [Limetown](https://www.twoupproductions.com/shows/limetown), season 2, and 1! The best \"radio-drama\" I’ve listened to. Season 2 started on Halloween this year and it’s now over. You can binge listen to it while walking on dark Albuquerque streets at night and freak out!\n  * [Reply All - 131 - Surefire Investigations](http://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all), a Yes-Yes-No that showcases Gritty, the new Philly Flyers’ mascot.\n  * [Reply All - 114 - Apocalypse Soon](http://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all): 2018 started strong.\n\n## Books\n\n  * [Algorithms to live](http://algorithmstoliveby.com/) by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths\n  * [The Index Card: Why Personal Finance Doesn't Have to Be Complicated](https://www.amazon.com/Index-Card-Personal-Finance-Complicated/dp/1591847680) by Helaine Olen and Harold Pollack\n  * [Thinking with Type](http://thinkingwithtype.com/) by Ellen Lupton\n\n## Things I learned\n\nDon’t use `sed` to replace spaces with new lines, use `tr` instead.

It&rsquo;s been on my to do list for a while to find a way to merge the two\njournals.

I figure I could probably write a script to do the merging.\nSo I downloaded Day One 2 on my iPhone and Mac, imported my Day One Classic\njournals, exported them as JSON to a folder on my Mac, and unzipped them. I\nalso created a <code>merged/</code> folder where to put the merged journal.
